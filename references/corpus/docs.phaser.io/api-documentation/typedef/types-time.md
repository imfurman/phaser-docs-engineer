tween Phaser.Types.Tweens.TweenBuilderConfig | Phaser.Types.Tweens.TweenChainBuilderConfig Phaser.Tweens.Tween Phaser.Tweens.TweenChain Yes
set object Yes null Object containing properties to set on the target when the Event fires if set.
sound string | object Yes null Sound configuration object which will be used to create a Sound when the Event fires if set.
target * Yes The scope ( this object) with which to invoke the run callback .
event string Yes Optional event name to emit when the Event fires.

<static> TimelineEventConfig ​
name type optional default description
at number Yes 0 The time (in ms) at which the Event will fire. The Timeline starts at 0.
in number Yes If the Timeline is running, this is the time (in ms) at which the Event will fire based on its current elapsed value. If set it will override the at property.
from number Yes Fire this event 'from' milliseconds after the previous event in the Timeline. If set it will override the at and in properties.
run function Yes A function which will be called when the Event fires.
loop function Yes A function which will be called when the Event loops, this does not get called if the repeat method is not used or on first iteration.
event string Yes Optional string-based event name to emit when the Event fires. The event is emitted from the Timeline instance.
target * Yes The scope ( this object) with which to invoke the run callback , if set.
once boolean Yes false If set, the Event will be removed from the Timeline when it fires.
stop boolean Yes false If set, the Timeline will stop and enter a complete state when this Event fires, even if there are other events after it.
tween Phaser.Types.Tweens.TweenBuilderConfig | Phaser.Types.Tweens.TweenChainBuilderConfig Phaser.Tweens.Tween Phaser.Tweens.TweenChain Yes
set object Yes A key-value object of properties to set on the target when the Event fires. Ignored if no target is given.
sound string | object Yes A key from the Sound Manager to play, or a config object for a sound to play when the Event fires. If a config object it must provide two properties: key and config .

<static> TimerEventConfig ​
name type optional default description
delay number Yes 0 The delay after which the Timer Event should fire, in milliseconds.
repeat number Yes 0 The total number of times the Timer Event will repeat before finishing.
loop boolean Yes false true if the Timer Event should repeat indefinitely.
callback function Yes The callback which will be called when the Timer Event fires.
callbackScope * Yes The scope ( this object) with which to invoke the callback . The default is the Timer Event.
args Array.<*> Yes Additional arguments to be passed to the callback .
timeScale number Yes 1 The scale of the elapsed time.
startAt number Yes 0 The initial elapsed time in milliseconds. Useful if you want a long duration with repeat, but for the first loop to fire quickly.
paused boolean Yes false true if the Timer Event should be paused.
