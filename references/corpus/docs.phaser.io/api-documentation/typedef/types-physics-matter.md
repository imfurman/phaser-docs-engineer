MatterBodyConfig ​
<static> MatterBodyConfig ​
name type optional default description
label string Yes "'Body'" An arbitrary string-based name to help identify this body.
shape string | Phaser.Types.Physics.Matter.MatterSetBodyConfig Yes null Set this Game Object to create and use a new Body based on the configuration object given.
parts Array.<MatterJS.BodyType> Yes An array of bodies that make up this body. The first body in the array must always be a self reference to the current body instance. All bodies in the parts array together form a single rigid compound body.
plugin any Yes An object reserved for storing plugin-specific properties.
wrapBounds any Yes An object for storing wrap boundaries.
angle number Yes 0 A number specifying the angle of the body, in radians.
vertices Array.< Phaser.Types.Math.Vector2Like > Yes null An array of Vector objects that specify the convex hull of the rigid body. These should be provided about the origin (0, 0) .
position Phaser.Types.Math.Vector2Like Yes A Vector that specifies the current world-space position of the body.
force Phaser.Types.Math.Vector2Like Yes A Vector that specifies the force to apply in the current step. It is zeroed after every Body.update . See also Body.applyForce .
torque number Yes 0 A Number that specifies the torque (turning force) to apply in the current step. It is zeroed after every Body.update .
isSensor boolean Yes false A flag that indicates whether a body is a sensor. Sensor triggers collision events, but doesn't react with colliding body physically.
isStatic boolean Yes false A flag that indicates whether a body is considered static. A static body can never change position or angle and is completely fixed.
sleepThreshold number Yes 60 A Number that defines the number of updates in which this body must have near-zero velocity before it is set as sleeping by the Matter.Sleeping module (if sleeping is enabled by the engine).
density number Yes 0.001 A Number that defines the density of the body, that is its mass per unit area. If you pass the density via Body.create the mass property is automatically calculated for you based on the size (area) of the object. This is generally preferable to simply setting mass and allows for more intuitive definition of materials (e.g. rock has a higher density than wood).
restitution number Yes 0 A Number that defines the restitution (elasticity) of the body. The value is always positive and is in the range (0, 1) .
friction number Yes 0.1 A Number that defines the friction of the body. The value is always positive and is in the range (0, 1) . A value of 0 means that the body may slide indefinitely. A value of 1 means the body may come to a stop almost instantly after a force is applied.
frictionStatic number Yes 0.5 A Number that defines the static friction of the body (in the Coulomb friction model). A value of 0 means the body will never 'stick' when it is nearly stationary and only dynamic friction is used. The higher the value (e.g. 10 ), the more force it will take to initially get the body moving when nearly stationary. This value is multiplied with the friction property to make it easier to change friction and maintain an appropriate amount of static friction.
frictionAir number Yes 0.01 A Number that defines the air friction of the body (air resistance). A value of 0 means the body will never slow as it moves through space. The higher the value, the faster a body slows when moving through space.
collisionFilter Phaser.Types.Physics.Matter.MatterCollisionFilter Yes An Object that specifies the collision filtering properties of this body.
slop number Yes 0.05 A Number that specifies a tolerance on how far a body is allowed to 'sink' or rotate into other bodies. Avoid changing this value unless you understand the purpose of slop in physics engines. The default should generally suffice, although very large bodies may require larger values for stable stacking.
timeScale number Yes 1 A Number that allows per-body time scaling, e.g. a force-field where bodies inside are in slow-motion, while others are at full speed.
chamfer number | Array.<number> Phaser.Types.Physics.Matter.MatterChamferConfig Yes null
circleRadius number Yes 0 The radius of this body if a circle.
mass number Yes 0 A Number that defines the mass of the body, although it may be more appropriate to specify the density property instead. If you modify this value, you must also modify the body.inverseMass property ( 1 / mass ).
inverseMass number Yes 0 A Number that defines the inverse mass of the body ( 1 / mass ). If you modify this value, you must also modify the body.mass property.
scale Phaser.Types.Math.Vector2Like Yes A Vector that specifies the initial scale of the body.
gravityScale Phaser.Types.Math.Vector2Like Yes A Vector that scales the influence of World gravity when applied to this body.
ignoreGravity boolean Yes false A boolean that toggles if this body should ignore world gravity or not.
ignorePointer boolean Yes false A boolean that toggles if this body should ignore pointer / mouse constraints or not.
render Phaser.Types.Physics.Matter.MatterBodyRenderConfig Yes The Debug Render configuration object for this body.
onCollideCallback function Yes A callback that is invoked when this Body starts colliding with any other Body. You can register callbacks by providing a function of type ( pair: Matter.Pair) => void .
onCollideEndCallback function Yes A callback that is invoked when this Body stops colliding with any other Body. You can register callbacks by providing a function of type ( pair: Matter.Pair) => void .
onCollideActiveCallback function Yes A callback that is invoked for the duration that this Body is colliding with any other Body. You can register callbacks by providing a function of type ( pair: Matter.Pair) => void .
onCollideWith any Yes A collision callback dictionary used by the Body.setOnCollideWith function.

MatterCollisionFilter ​
<static> MatterCollisionFilter ​
An Object that specifies the collision filtering properties of this body.
Collisions between two bodies will obey the following rules:
If the two bodies have the same non-zero value of collisionFilter.group ,
they will always collide if the value is positive, and they will never collide
if the value is negative.
If the two bodies have different values of collisionFilter.group or if one
(or both) of the bodies has a value of 0, then the category/mask rules apply as follows:
Each body belongs to a collision category, given by collisionFilter.category . This
value is used as a bit field and the category should have only one bit set, meaning that
the value of this property is a power of two in the range [1, 2^31]. Thus, there are 32
different collision categories available.
Each body also defines a collision bitmask, given by collisionFilter.mask which specifies
the categories it collides with (the value is the bitwise AND value of all these categories).
Using the category/mask rules, two bodies A and B collide if each includes the other's
category in its mask, i.e. (categoryA & maskB) !== 0 and (categoryB & maskA) !== 0
are both true.
name type optional default description
category number Yes "0x0001" A bit field that specifies the collision category this body belongs to. The category value should have only one bit set, for example 0x0001 . This means there are up to 32 unique collision categories available.
mask number Yes "0xFFFFFFFF" A bit mask that specifies the collision categories this body may collide with.
group number Yes 0 An Integer Number , that specifies the collision group this body belongs to.
