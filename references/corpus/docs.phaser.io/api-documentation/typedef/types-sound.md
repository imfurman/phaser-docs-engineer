Types.Sound
AudioSpriteSound ​
<static> AudioSpriteSound ​
Audio sprite sound type.
name type optional description
spritemap object No Local reference to 'spritemap' object form json file generated by audiosprite tool.
Type : object
Member of : Phaser.Types.Sound
Source: src/sound/typedefs/AudioSpriteSound.js#L1
Since: 3.0.0
DecodeAudioConfig ​
<static> DecodeAudioConfig ​
A Audio Data object.
You can pass an array of these objects to the WebAudioSoundManager decodeAudio method to have it decode
them all at once.
name type optional description
key string No The string-based key to be used to reference the decoded audio in the audio cache.
data ArrayBuffer | string No The audio data, either a base64 encoded string, an audio media-type data uri, or an ArrayBuffer instance.

EachActiveSoundCallback ​
<static> EachActiveSoundCallback ​
Type : function
Member of : Phaser.Types.Sound
Source: src/sound/typedefs/EachActiveSoundCallback.js#L1

SoundConfig ​
<static> SoundConfig ​
Config object containing various sound settings.
name type optional default description
mute boolean Yes false Boolean indicating whether the sound should be muted or not.
volume number Yes 1 A value between 0 (silence) and 1 (full volume).
rate number Yes 1 Defines the speed at which the sound should be played.
detune number Yes 0 Represents detuning of sound in cents .
seek number Yes 0 Position of playback for this sound, in seconds.
loop boolean Yes false Whether or not the sound or current sound marker should loop.
delay number Yes 0 Time, in seconds, that should elapse before the sound actually starts its playback.
pan number Yes 0 A value between -1 (full left pan) and 1 (full right pan). 0 means no pan.
source Phaser.Types.Sound.SpatialSoundConfig Yes null An optional config object containing default spatial sound settings.
Type : object
Member of : Phaser.Types.Sound
Source: src/sound/typedefs/SoundConfig.js#L1
Since: 3.0.0
SoundMarker ​
<static> SoundMarker ​
Marked section of a sound represented by name, and optionally start time, duration, and config object.
name type optional default description
name string No Unique identifier of a sound marker.
start number Yes 0 Sound position offset at witch playback should start.
duration number Yes Playback duration of this marker.
config Phaser.Types.Sound.SoundConfig Yes An optional config object containing default marker settings.
Type : object
Member of : Phaser.Types.Sound
Source: src/sound/typedefs/SoundMarker.js#L1
Since: 3.0.0
SpatialSoundConfig ​
<static> SpatialSoundConfig ​
Config object containing settings for the source of the spatial sound.
See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Web_audio_spatialization_basics
name type optional default description
x number Yes 0 The horizontal position of the audio in a right-hand Cartesian coordinate system.
y number Yes 0 The vertical position of the audio in a right-hand Cartesian coordinate system.
z number Yes 0 Represents the longitudinal (back and forth) position of the audio in a right-hand Cartesian coordinate system.
panningModel 'equalpower' | 'HRTF' Yes "'equalpower'" An enumerated value determining which spatialization algorithm to use to position the audio in 3D space.
distanceModel 'linear' | 'inverse' 'exponential' Yes "'inverse'"
orientationX number Yes 0 The horizontal position of the audio source's vector in a right-hand Cartesian coordinate system.
orientationY number Yes 0 The vertical position of the audio source's vector in a right-hand Cartesian coordinate system.
orientationZ number Yes -1 Represents the longitudinal (back and forth) position of the audio source's vector in a right-hand Cartesian coordinate system.
refDistance number Yes 1 A double value representing the reference distance for reducing volume as the audio source moves further from the listener. For distances greater than this the volume will be reduced based on rolloffFactor and distanceModel .
maxDistance number Yes 10000 The maximum distance between the audio source and the listener, after which the volume is not reduced any further.
rolloffFactor number Yes 1 A double value describing how quickly the volume is reduced as the source moves away from the listener. This value is used by all distance models.
coneInnerAngle number Yes 360 The angle, in degrees, of a cone inside of which there will be no volume reduction.
coneOuterAngle number Yes 0 The angle, in degrees, of a cone outside of which the volume will be reduced by a constant value, defined by the coneOuterGain property.
coneOuterGain number Yes 0 The amount of volume reduction outside the cone defined by the coneOuterAngle attribute. Its default value is 0, meaning that no sound can be heard. A value between 0 and 1.
follow Phaser.Types.Math.Vector2Like Yes Set this Sound object to automatically track the x/y position of this object. Can be a Phaser Game Object, Vec2 or anything that exposes public x/y properties.

WebAudioDecodeEntry ​
<static> WebAudioDecodeEntry ​
An entry in the Web Audio Decoding Queue.
name type optional description
key string No The key of the sound.
success function No The callback to invoke on successful decoding.
failure function No The callback to invoke if the decoding fails.
decoding boolean No Has the decoding of this sound file started?
