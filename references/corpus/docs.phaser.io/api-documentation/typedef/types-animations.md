Types.Animations
Animation ​
<static> Animation ​
name type optional default description
key string Yes The key that the animation will be associated with. i.e. sprite.animations.play(key)
frames string | Array.< Phaser.Types.Animations.AnimationFrame > Yes Either a string, in which case it will use all frames from a texture with the matching key, or an array of Animation Frame configuration objects.
sortFrames boolean Yes true If you provide a string for frames you can optionally have the frame names numerically sorted.
defaultTextureKey string Yes null The key of the texture all frames of the animation will use. Can be overridden on a per frame basis.
frameRate number Yes The frame rate of playback in frames per second (default 24 if duration is null)
duration number Yes How long the animation should play for in milliseconds. If not given its derived from frameRate.
skipMissedFrames boolean Yes true Skip frames if the time lags, or always advanced anyway?
delay number Yes 0 Delay before starting playback. Value given in milliseconds.
repeat number Yes 0 Number of times to repeat the animation (-1 for infinity)
repeatDelay number Yes 0 Delay before the animation repeats. Value given in milliseconds.
yoyo boolean Yes false Should the animation yoyo? (reverse back down to the start) before repeating?
showBeforeDelay boolean Yes false If this animation has a delay, should it show the first frame immediately (true), or only after the delay (false)
showOnStart boolean Yes false Should sprite.visible = true when the animation starts to play? This happens after any delay, if set.
hideOnComplete boolean Yes false Should sprite.visible = false when the animation finishes?
randomFrame boolean Yes false Start playback of this animation from a randomly selected frame?

AnimationFrame ​
<static> AnimationFrame ​
name type optional default description
key string Yes The key of the texture within the Texture Manager to use for this Animation Frame.
frame string | number Yes The key, or index number, of the frame within the texture to use for this Animation Frame.
duration number Yes 0 The duration, in ms, of this frame of the animation.
visible boolean Yes Should the parent Game Object be visible during this frame of the animation?

GenerateFrameNames ​
<static> GenerateFrameNames ​
name type optional default description
prefix string Yes "''" The string to append to every resulting frame name if using a range or an array of frames .
start number Yes 0 If frames is not provided, the number of the first frame to return.
end number Yes 0 If frames is not provided, the number of the last frame to return.
suffix string Yes "''" The string to append to every resulting frame name if using a range or an array of frames .
zeroPad number Yes 0 The minimum expected lengths of each resulting frame's number. Numbers will be left-padded with zeroes until they are this long, then prepended and appended to create the resulting frame name.
outputArray Array.< Phaser.Types.Animations.AnimationFrame > Yes "[]" The array to append the created configuration objects to.
frames boolean | Array.<number> Yes false If provided as an array, the range defined by start and end will be ignored and these frame numbers will be used.

GenerateFrameNumbers ​
<static> GenerateFrameNumbers ​
name type optional default description
start number Yes 0 The starting frame of the animation.
end number Yes -1 The ending frame of the animation.
first boolean | number Yes false A frame to put at the beginning of the animation, before start or outputArray or frames .
outputArray Array.< Phaser.Types.Animations.AnimationFrame > Yes "[]" An array to concatenate the output onto.
frames boolean | Array.<number> Yes false A custom sequence of frames.

JSONAnimation ​
<static> JSONAnimation ​
name type optional description
key string No The key that the animation will be associated with. i.e. sprite.animations.play(key)
type string No A frame based animation (as opposed to a bone based animation)
frames Array.< Phaser.Types.Animations.JSONAnimationFrame > No An array of the AnimationFrame objects inside this Animation.
frameRate number No The frame rate of playback in frames per second (default 24 if duration is null)
duration number No How long the animation should play for in milliseconds. If not given its derived from frameRate.
skipMissedFrames boolean No Skip frames if the time lags, or always advanced anyway?
delay number No Delay before starting playback. Value given in milliseconds.
repeat number No Number of times to repeat the animation (-1 for infinity)
repeatDelay number No Delay before the animation repeats. Value given in milliseconds.
yoyo boolean No Should the animation yoyo? (reverse back down to the start) before repeating?
showBeforeDelay boolean No If this animation has a delay, should it show the first frame immediately (true), or only after the delay (false)
showOnStart boolean No Should sprite.visible = true when the animation starts to play?
hideOnComplete boolean No Should sprite.visible = false when the animation finishes?
randomFrame boolean Yes Start playback of this animation from a randomly selected frame?
