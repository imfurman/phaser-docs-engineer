TWEEN_ACTIVE ​
Description: The Tween Active Event.
This event is dispatched by a Tween when it becomes active within the Tween Manager.
An 'active' Tween is one that is now progressing, although it may not yet be updating
any target properties, due to settings such as delay . If you need an event for when
the Tween starts actually updating its first property, see TWEEN_START .
Listen to it from a Tween instance using Tween.on('active', listener) , i.e.:
var tween = this . tweens . create ( {
targets : image ,
x : 500 ,
ease : 'Power1' ,
duration : 3000
} ) ;
tween . on ( 'active' , listener ) ;
this . tweens . existing ( tween ) ;
Note that this event is usually dispatched already by the time you call this.tweens.add() , and is
meant for use with tweens.create() and/or tweens.existing() .

targets any | Array.<any> No The targets of the Tween. If this Tween has multiple targets this will be an array of the targets.

TWEEN_COMPLETE ​
Description: The Tween Complete Event.
This event is dispatched by a Tween when it completes playback entirely, factoring in repeats and loops.
If the Tween has been set to loop or repeat infinitely, this event will not be dispatched
unless the Tween.stop method is called.
If a Tween has a completeDelay set, this event will fire after that delay expires.
Listen to it from a Tween instance using Tween.on('complete', listener) , i.e.:
var tween = this . tweens . add ( {
targets : image ,
x : 500 ,
ease : 'Power1' ,
duration : 3000
} ) ;
tween . on ( 'complete' , listener ) ;
name type optional description
tween Phaser.Tweens.Tween No A reference to the Tween instance that emitted the event.
targets any | Array.<any> No The targets of the Tween. If this Tween has multiple targets this will be an array of the targets.

TWEEN_LOOP ​
Description: The Tween Loop Event.
This event is dispatched by a Tween when it loops.
This event will only be dispatched if the Tween has a loop count set.
If a Tween has a loopDelay set, this event will fire after that delay expires.
The difference between loop and repeat is that repeat is a property setting,
where-as loop applies to the entire Tween.
Listen to it from a Tween instance using Tween.on('loop', listener) , i.e.:
var tween = this . tweens . add ( {
targets : image ,
x : 500 ,
ease : 'Power1' ,
duration : 3000 ,
loop : 6
} ) ;
tween . on ( 'loop' , listener ) ;
name type optional description
tween Phaser.Tweens.Tween No A reference to the Tween instance that emitted the event.
targets any | Array.<any> No The targets of the Tween. If this Tween has multiple targets this will be an array of the targets.

TWEEN_PAUSE ​
Description: The Tween Pause Event.
This event is dispatched by a Tween when it is paused.
Listen to it from a Tween instance using Tween.on('pause', listener) , i.e.:
var tween = this . tweens . add ( {
targets : image ,
ease : 'Power1' ,
duration : 3000 ,
x : 600
} ) ;
tween . on ( 'pause' , listener ) ;
// At some point later ...
tween . pause ( ) ;

TWEEN_REPEAT ​
Description: The Tween Repeat Event.
This event is dispatched by a Tween when one of the properties it is tweening repeats.
This event will only be dispatched if the Tween has a property with a repeat count set.
If a Tween has a repeatDelay set, this event will fire after that delay expires.
The difference between loop and repeat is that repeat is a property setting,
where-as loop applies to the entire Tween.
Listen to it from a Tween instance using Tween.on('repeat', listener) , i.e.:
var tween = this . tweens . add ( {
targets : image ,
x : 500 ,
ease : 'Power1' ,
duration : 3000 ,
repeat : 4
} ) ;
tween . on ( 'repeat' , listener ) ;
name type optional description
tween Phaser.Tweens.Tween No A reference to the Tween instance that emitted the event.
key string No The property on the target that has just repeated, i.e. x or scaleY , or whatever property you are tweening.
target any No The target object that was repeated. Usually a Game Object, but can be of any type.
current number No The current value of the property being set on the target.
previous number No The previous value of the property being set on the target.

TWEEN_RESUME ​
Description: The Tween Resume Event.
This event is dispatched by a Tween when it is resumed from a paused state.
Listen to it from a Tween instance using Tween.on('resume', listener) , i.e.:
var tween = this . tweens . add ( {
targets : image ,
ease : 'Power1' ,
duration : 3000 ,
x : 600
} ) ;
tween . on ( 'resume' , listener ) ;
// At some point later ...
tween . resume ( ) ;

TWEEN_START ​
Description: The Tween Start Event.
This event is dispatched by a Tween when it starts tweening its first property.
A Tween will only emit this event once, as it can only start once.
If a Tween has a delay set, this event will fire after that delay expires.
Listen to it from a Tween instance using Tween.on('start', listener) , i.e.:
var tween = this . tweens . add ( {
targets : image ,
x : 500 ,
ease : 'Power1' ,
duration : 3000
} ) ;
tween . on ( 'start' , listener ) ;
name type optional description
tween Phaser.Tweens.Tween No A reference to the Tween instance that emitted the event.
targets any | Array.<any> No The targets of the Tween. If this Tween has multiple targets this will be an array of the targets.

TWEEN_STOP ​
Description: The Tween Stop Event.
This event is dispatched by a Tween when it is stopped.
Listen to it from a Tween instance using Tween.on('stop', listener) , i.e.:
var tween = this . tweens . add ( {
targets : image ,
x : 500 ,
ease : 'Power1' ,
duration : 3000
} ) ;
tween . on ( 'stop' , listener ) ;

TWEEN_UPDATE ​
Description: The Tween Update Event.
This event is dispatched by a Tween every time it updates any of the properties it is tweening.
A Tween that is changing 3 properties of a target will emit this event 3 times per change, once per property.
Note: This is a very high frequency event and may be dispatched multiple times, every single frame.
Listen to it from a Tween instance using Tween.on('update', listener) , i.e.:
var tween = this . tweens . add ( {
targets : image ,
x : 500 ,
ease : 'Power1' ,
duration : 3000 ,
} ) ;
tween . on ( 'update' , listener ) ;
name type optional description
tween Phaser.Tweens.Tween No A reference to the Tween instance that emitted the event.
key string No The property on the target that has just updated, i.e. x or scaleY , or whatever property you are tweening.
target any No The target object that was updated. Usually a Game Object, but can be of any type.
current number No The current value of the property that was tweened.
previous number No The previous value of the property that was tweened, prior to this update.

TWEEN_YOYO ​
Description: The Tween Yoyo Event.
This event is dispatched by a Tween whenever a property it is tweening yoyos.
This event will only be dispatched if the Tween has a property with yoyo set.
If the Tween has a hold value, this event is dispatched when the hold expires.
This event is dispatched for every property, and for every target, that yoyos.
For example, if a Tween was updating 2 properties and had 10 targets, this event
would be dispatched 20 times (twice per target). So be careful how you use it!
Listen to it from a Tween instance using Tween.on('yoyo', listener) , i.e.:
var tween = this . tweens . add ( {
targets : image ,
x : 500 ,
ease : 'Power1' ,
duration : 3000 ,
yoyo : true
} ) ;
tween . on ( 'yoyo' , listener ) ;
name type optional description
tween Phaser.Tweens.Tween No A reference to the Tween instance that emitted the event.
key string No The property on the target that has just yoyo'd, i.e. x or scaleY , or whatever property you are tweening.
target any No The target object that was yoyo'd. Usually a Game Object, but can be of any type.
current number No The current value of the property being set on the target.
previous number No The previous value of the property being set on the target.
