Physics.Arcade.Events
COLLIDE ​
Description: The Arcade Physics World Collide Event.
This event is dispatched by an Arcade Physics World instance if two bodies collide and at least
one of them has their [onCollide]{@link Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Body#onCollide} property set to true .
It provides an alternative means to handling collide events rather than using the callback approach.
Listen to it from a Scene using: this.physics.world.on('collide', listener) .
Please note that 'collide' and 'overlap' are two different things in Arcade Physics.
name type optional description
gameObject1 Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject No The first Game Object involved in the collision. This is the parent of body1 .
gameObject2 Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject No The second Game Object involved in the collision. This is the parent of body2 .
body1 Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Body | Phaser.Physics.Arcade.StaticBody No The first Physics Body involved in the collision.
body2 Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Body | Phaser.Physics.Arcade.StaticBody No The second Physics Body involved in the collision.

OVERLAP ​
Description: The Arcade Physics World Overlap Event.
This event is dispatched by an Arcade Physics World instance if two bodies overlap and at least
one of them has their [onOverlap]{@link Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Body#onOverlap} property set to true .
It provides an alternative means to handling overlap events rather than using the callback approach.
Listen to it from a Scene using: this.physics.world.on('overlap', listener) .
Please note that 'collide' and 'overlap' are two different things in Arcade Physics.
name type optional description
gameObject1 Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject No The first Game Object involved in the overlap. This is the parent of body1 .
gameObject2 Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject No The second Game Object involved in the overlap. This is the parent of body2 .
body1 Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Body | Phaser.Physics.Arcade.StaticBody No The first Physics Body involved in the overlap.
body2 Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Body | Phaser.Physics.Arcade.StaticBody No The second Physics Body involved in the overlap.

PAUSE ​
Description: The Arcade Physics World Pause Event.
This event is dispatched by an Arcade Physics World instance when it is paused.
Listen to it from a Scene using: this.physics.world.on('pause', listener) .

RESUME ​
Description: The Arcade Physics World Resume Event.
This event is dispatched by an Arcade Physics World instance when it resumes from a paused state.
Listen to it from a Scene using: this.physics.world.on('resume', listener) .

TILE_COLLIDE ​
Description: The Arcade Physics Tile Collide Event.
This event is dispatched by an Arcade Physics World instance if a body collides with a Tile and
has its [onCollide]{@link Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Body#onCollide} property set to true .
It provides an alternative means to handling collide events rather than using the callback approach.
Listen to it from a Scene using: this.physics.world.on('tilecollide', listener) .
Please note that 'collide' and 'overlap' are two different things in Arcade Physics.
name type optional description
gameObject Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject No The Game Object involved in the collision. This is the parent of body .
tile Phaser.Tilemaps.Tile No The tile the body collided with.
body Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Body No The Arcade Physics Body of the Game Object involved in the collision.

TILE_OVERLAP ​
Description: The Arcade Physics Tile Overlap Event.
This event is dispatched by an Arcade Physics World instance if a body overlaps with a Tile and
has its [onOverlap]{@link Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Body#onOverlap} property set to true .
It provides an alternative means to handling overlap events rather than using the callback approach.
Listen to it from a Scene using: this.physics.world.on('tileoverlap', listener) .
Please note that 'collide' and 'overlap' are two different things in Arcade Physics.
name type optional description
gameObject Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject No The Game Object involved in the overlap. This is the parent of body .
tile Phaser.Tilemaps.Tile No The tile the body overlapped.
body Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Body No The Arcade Physics Body of the Game Object involved in the overlap.

WORLD_BOUNDS ​
Description: The Arcade Physics World Bounds Event.
This event is dispatched by an Arcade Physics World instance if a body makes contact with the world bounds and
it has its [onWorldBounds]{@link Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Body#onWorldBounds} property set to true .
It provides an alternative means to handling collide events rather than using the callback approach.
Listen to it from a Scene using: this.physics.world.on('worldbounds', listener) .
name type optional description
body Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Body No The Arcade Physics Body that hit the world bounds.
up boolean No Is the Body blocked up? I.e. collided with the top of the world bounds.
down boolean No Is the Body blocked down? I.e. collided with the bottom of the world bounds.
left boolean No Is the Body blocked left? I.e. collided with the left of the world bounds.
right boolean No Is the Body blocked right? I.e. collided with the right of the world bounds.

WORLD_STEP ​
Description: The Arcade Physics World Step Event.
This event is dispatched by an Arcade Physics World instance whenever a physics step is run.
It is emitted after the bodies and colliders have been updated.
In high framerate settings this can be multiple times per game frame.
Listen to it from a Scene using: this.physics.world.on('worldstep', listener) .
name type optional description
delta number No The delta time amount of this step, in seconds.
