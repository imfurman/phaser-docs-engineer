SeparateX ​
<static> SeparateX(body1, body2, overlapOnly, bias, [overlap]) ​
Description:
Separates two overlapping bodies on the X-axis (horizontally).
Separation involves moving two overlapping bodies so they don't overlap anymore and adjusting their velocities based on their mass. This is a core part of collision detection.
The bodies won't be separated if there is no horizontal overlap between them, if they are static, or if either one uses custom logic for its separation.
Parameters:
name type optional description
body1 Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Body No The first Body to separate.
body2 Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Body No The second Body to separate.
overlapOnly boolean No If true , the bodies will only have their overlap data set and no separation will take place.
bias number No A value to add to the delta value during overlap checking. Used to prevent sprite tunneling.
overlap number Yes If given then this value will be used as the overlap and no check will be run.
Returns: boolean - true if the two bodies overlap vertically, otherwise false .
Source: src/physics/arcade/SeparateX.js#L10
Since: 3.0.0
SeparateY ​
<static> SeparateY(body1, body2, overlapOnly, bias, [overlap]) ​
Description:
Separates two overlapping bodies on the Y-axis (vertically).
Separation involves moving two overlapping bodies so they don't overlap anymore and adjusting their velocities based on their mass. This is a core part of collision detection.
The bodies won't be separated if there is no vertical overlap between them, if they are static, or if either one uses custom logic for its separation.
Parameters:
