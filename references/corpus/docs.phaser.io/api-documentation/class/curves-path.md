Path
A Path combines multiple Curves into one continuous compound curve.
It does not matter how many Curves are in the Path or what type they are.
A Curve in a Path does not have to start where the previous Curve ends - that is to say, a Path does not
have to be an uninterrupted curve. Only the order of the Curves influences the actual points on the Path.
Constructor
new Path([x], [y])
Parameters
name type optional default description
x number Yes 0 The X coordinate of the Path's starting point or a {@link Phaser.Types.Curves.JSONPath}.
y number Yes 0 The Y coordinate of the Path's starting point.
Scope : static

defaultDivisions ​
defaultDivisions: number ​
Description:
The default number of divisions within a curve.
Source: src/curves/path/Path.js#L57
Since: 3.70.0
name ​
name: string ​
Description:
The name of this Path.
Empty by default and never populated by Phaser, this is left for developers to use.
Source: src/curves/path/Path.js#L46
Since: 3.0.0
startPoint ​
startPoint: Phaser.Math.Vector2 ​
Description:
The starting point of the Path.
This is not necessarily equivalent to the starting point of the first Curve in the Path. In an empty Path, it's also treated as the ending point.
Source: src/curves/path/Path.js#L99
Since: 3.0.0
Public Methods ​
add ​
<instance> add(curve) ​
Description:
Appends a Curve to the end of the Path.
The Curve does not have to start where the Path ends or, for an empty Path, at its defined starting point.
Parameters:
name type optional description
curve Phaser.Curves.Curve No The Curve to append.
Returns: Phaser.Curves.Path - This Path object.
Source: src/curves/path/Path.js#L140
Since: 3.0.0
circleTo ​
<instance> circleTo(radius, [clockwise], [rotation]) ​
Description:
Creates a circular Ellipse Curve positioned at the end of the Path.
Parameters:
name type optional default description
radius number No The radius of the circle.
clockwise boolean Yes false true to create a clockwise circle as opposed to a counter-clockwise circle.
rotation number Yes 0 The rotation of the circle in degrees.
Returns: Phaser.Curves.Path - This Path object.
Source: src/curves/path/Path.js#L159
Since: 3.0.0
closePath ​
<instance> closePath() ​
Description:
Ensures that the Path is closed.
A closed Path starts and ends at the same point. If the Path is not closed, a straight Line Curve will be created from the ending point directly to the starting point. During the check, the actual starting point of the Path, i.e. the starting point of the first Curve, will be used as opposed to the Path's defined startPoint , which could differ.
Calling this method on an empty Path will result in an error.
Returns: Phaser.Curves.Path - This Path object.

Since: 3.0.0
getCurveAt ​

getCurveLengths ​
<instance> getCurveLengths() ​
Description:
Returns an array containing the length of the Path at the end of each Curve.
The result of this method will be cached to avoid recalculating it in subsequent calls. The cache is only invalidated when the #curves array changes in length, leading to potential inaccuracies if a Curve in the Path is changed, or if a Curve is removed and another is added in its place.
Returns: Array.<number> - An array containing the length of the Path at the end of each one of its Curves.
Source: src/curves/path/Path.js#L445
Since: 3.0.0
getEndPoint ​
<instance> getEndPoint([out]) ​
Description:

A Path's ending point is equivalent to the ending point of the last Curve in the Path. For an empty Path, the ending point is at the Path's defined #startPoint .
Tags:
generic
Parameters:
name type optional description
out Phaser.Math.Vector2 Yes The object to store the point in.
Returns: Phaser.Math.Vector2 - The modified out object, or a new Vector2 if none was provided.
Source: src/curves/path/Path.js#L511

getLength ​
<instance> getLength() ​
Description:

Source: src/curves/path/Path.js#L541
Since: 3.0.0
getPoint ​
<instance> getPoint(t, [out]) ​
Description:
Calculates the coordinates of the point at the given normalized location (between 0 and 1) on the Path.
The location is relative to the entire Path, not to an individual Curve. A location of 0.5 is always in the middle of the Path and is thus an equal distance away from both its starting and ending points. In a Path with one Curve, it would be in the middle of the Curve; in a Path with two Curves, it could be anywhere on either one of them depending on their lengths.
