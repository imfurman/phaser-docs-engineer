RotateTo
A Camera Rotate effect.
This effect will rotate the Camera so that the its viewport finishes at the given angle in radians,
over the duration and with the ease specified.
Camera rotation always takes place based on the Camera viewport. By default, rotation happens
in the center of the viewport. You can adjust this with the originX and originY properties.
Rotation influences the rendering of all Game Objects visible by this Camera. However, it does not
rotate the Camera viewport itself, which always remains an axis-aligned rectangle.
Only the camera is rotates. None of the objects it is displaying are impacted, i.e. their positions do
not change.
The effect will dispatch several events on the Camera itself and you can also specify an onUpdate callback,
which is invoked each frame for the duration of the effect if required.

Public Methods ​
destroy ​
<instance> destroy() ​
Description:
Destroys this effect, releasing it from the Camera.

Since: 3.23.0
effectComplete ​
<instance> effectComplete() ​

reset ​
<instance> reset() ​
Description:
Resets this camera effect.
If it was previously running, it stops instantly without calling its onComplete callback or emitting an event.
Source: src/cameras/2d/effects/RotateTo.js#L395
Since: 3.23.0
start ​
<instance> start(radians, [shortestPath], [duration], [ease], [force], [callback], [context]) ​
Description:
This effect will scroll the Camera so that the center of its viewport finishes at the given angle,
over the duration and with the ease specified.
Parameters:
name type optional default description
radians number No The destination angle in radians to rotate the Camera viewport to. If the angle is positive then the rotation is clockwise else anticlockwise
shortestPath boolean Yes false If shortest path is set to true the camera will rotate in the quickest direction clockwise or anti-clockwise.
duration number Yes 1000 The duration of the effect in milliseconds.
ease string | function Yes "'Linear'" The ease to use for the Rotate. Can be any of the Phaser Easing constants or a custom function.
force boolean Yes false Force the rotation effect to start immediately, even if already running.
callback CameraRotateCallback Yes This callback will be invoked every frame for the duration of the effect. It is sent four arguments: A reference to the camera, a progress amount between 0 and 1 indicating how complete the effect is, the current camera scroll x coordinate and the current camera scroll y coordinate.
context any Yes The context in which the callback is invoked. Defaults to the Scene to which the Camera belongs.
Returns: Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D.Camera - The Camera on which the effect was started.
Fires: Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D.Events#event:ROTATE_START , Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D.Events#event:ROTATE_COMPLETE

update ​
<instance> update(time, delta) ​
Description:
The main update loop for this effect. Called automatically by the Camera.
Parameters:
name type optional description
time number No The current timestamp as generated by the Request Animation Frame or SetTimeout.
delta number No The delta time, in ms, elapsed since the last frame.
