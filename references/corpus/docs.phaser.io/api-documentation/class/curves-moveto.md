MoveTo
A MoveTo Curve is a very simple curve consisting of only a single point.
Its intended use is to move the ending point in a Path.
Constructor
new MoveTo([x], [y])
Parameters
name type optional default description
x number Yes 0 x pixel coordinate.
y number Yes 0 y pixel coordinate.
Scope : static

active ​
active: boolean ​
Description:
Denotes that this Curve does not influence the bounds, points, and drawing of its parent Path. Must be false or some methods in the parent Path will throw errors.

Since: 3.0.0
p0 ​
p0: Phaser.Math.Vector2 ​
Description:
The lone point which this curve consists of.

Since: 3.0.0
Public Methods ​
getLength ​
<instance> getLength() ​
Description:
Gets the length of this curve.
Returns: number - The length of this curve. For a MoveTo the value is always 0.
Source: src/curves/path/MoveTo.js#L100
Since: 3.0.0
getPoint ​
<instance> getPoint(t, [out]) ​
Description:
Get point at relative position in curve according to length.
Tags:
generic
Parameters:
name type optional description
t number No The position along the curve to return. Where 0 is the start and 1 is the end.
out Phaser.Math.Vector2 Yes A Vector2 object to store the result in. If not given will be created.
Returns: Phaser.Math.Vector2 - The coordinates of the point on the curve. If an out object was given this will be returned.
Source: src/curves/path/MoveTo.js#L49
Since: 3.0.0
getPointAt ​
<instance> getPointAt(u, [out]) ​
Description:
Retrieves the point at given position in the curve. This will always return this curve's only point.
Tags:
generic
Parameters:
name type optional description
u number No The position in the path to retrieve, between 0 and 1. Not used.
out Phaser.Math.Vector2 Yes An optional vector in which to store the point.
Returns: Phaser.Math.Vector2 - The modified out vector, or a new Vector2 if none was provided.
Source: src/curves/path/MoveTo.js#L69
Since: 3.0.0
getResolution ​
<instance> getResolution() ​
Description:
Gets the resolution of this curve.
Returns: number - The resolution of this curve. For a MoveTo the value is always 1.
Source: src/curves/path/MoveTo.js#L87
Since: 3.0.0
toJSON ​
<instance> toJSON() ​
Description:
Converts this curve into a JSON-serializable object.
Returns: Phaser.Types.Curves.JSONCurve - A primitive object with the curve's type and only point.
