MultiFile
A MultiFile is a special kind of parent that contains two, or more, Files as children and looks after
the loading and processing of them all. It is commonly extended and used as a base class for file types such as AtlasJSON or BitmapFont.
You shouldn't create an instance of a MultiFile directly, but should extend it with your own class, setting a custom type and processing methods.
