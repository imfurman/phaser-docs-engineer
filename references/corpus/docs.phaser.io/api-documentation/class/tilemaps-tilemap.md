Tilemap
A Tilemap is a container for Tilemap data. This isn't a display object, rather, it holds data
about the map and allows you to add tilesets and tilemap layers to it. A map can have one or
more tilemap layers, which are the display objects that actually render the tiles.
The Tilemap data can be parsed from a Tiled JSON file, a CSV file or a 2D array. Tiled is a free
software package specifically for creating tile maps, and is available from:
http://www.mapeditor.org
As of Phaser 3.50.0 the Tilemap API now supports the following types of map:
Orthogonal
Isometric
Hexagonal
Staggered
Prior to this release, only orthogonal maps were supported.
Another large change in 3.50 was the consolidation of Tilemap Layers. Previously, you created
either a Static or Dynamic Tilemap Layer. However, as of 3.50 the features of both have been
merged and the API simplified, so now there is just the single TilemapLayer class.
A Tilemap has handy methods for getting and manipulating the tiles within a layer, allowing
you to build or modify the tilemap data at runtime.
Note that all Tilemaps use a base tile size to calculate dimensions from, but that a
TilemapLayer may have its own unique tile size that overrides this.
As of Phaser 3.21.0, if your tilemap includes layer groups (a feature of Tiled 1.2.0+) these
will be traversed and the following properties will impact children:
Opacity (blended with parent) and visibility (parent overrides child)
Vertical and horizontal offset
The grouping hierarchy is not preserved and all layers will be flattened into a single array.
Group layers are parsed during Tilemap construction but are discarded after parsing so dynamic
layers will NOT continue to be affected by a parent.
To avoid duplicate layer names, a layer that is a child of a group layer will have its parent
group name prepended with a '/'. For example, consider a group called 'ParentGroup' with a
child called 'Layer 1'. In the Tilemap object, 'Layer 1' will have the name
'ParentGroup/Layer 1'.
The Phaser Tiled Parser does not support the 'Collection of Images' feature for a Tileset.
You must ensure all of your tiles are contained in a single tileset image file (per layer)
and have this 'embedded' in the exported Tiled JSON map data.

Source: src/tilemaps/Tilemap.js#L501
Since: 3.0.0
createFromObjects ​
<instance> createFromObjects(objectLayerName, config, [useTileset]) ​
Description:
This method will iterate through all of the objects defined in a Tiled Object Layer and then
convert the matching results into Phaser Game Objects (by default, Sprites)
Objects are matched on one of 4 criteria: The Object ID, the Object GID, the Object Name, or the Object Type.
Within Tiled, Object IDs are unique per Object. Object GIDs, however, are shared by all objects
using the same image. Finally, Object Names and Types are strings and the same name can be used on multiple
Objects in Tiled, they do not have to be unique; Names are specific to Objects while Types can be inherited
from Object GIDs using the same image.
You set the configuration parameter accordingly, based on which type of criteria you wish
to match against. For example, to convert all items on an Object Layer with a gid of 26:
createFromObjects ( layerName , {
gid : 26
} ) ;
Or, to convert objects with the name 'bonus':
createFromObjects ( layerName , {
name : 'bonus'
} ) ;
Or, to convert an object with a specific id:
createFromObjects ( layerName , {
id : 9
} ) ;
You should only specify either id , gid , name , type , or none of them. Do not add more than
one criteria to your config. If you do not specify any criteria, then all objects in the
Object Layer will be converted.
By default this method will convert Objects into Phaser.GameObjects.Sprite instances, but you can override
this by providing your own class type:
createFromObjects ( layerName , {
gid : 26 ,
classType : Coin
} ) ;
This will convert all Objects with a gid of 26 into your custom Coin class. You can pass
any class type here, but it must extend Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject as its base class.
Your class will always be passed 1 parameter: scene , which is a reference to either the Scene
specified in the config object or, if not given, the Scene to which this Tilemap belongs. The
class must have setPosition and
setTexture methods.
This method will set the following Tiled Object properties on the new Game Object:
flippedHorizontal as flipX
flippedVertical as flipY
height as displayHeight
name
rotation
visible
width as displayWidth
x , adjusted for origin
y , adjusted for origin
Additionally, this method will set Tiled Object custom properties
on the Game Object, if it has the same property name and a value that isn't undefined ; or
on the Game Object's data otherwise.
For example, a Tiled Object with custom properties { alpha: 0.5, gold: 1 } will be created as a Game
Object with an alpha value of 0.5 and a data.values.gold value of 1.
When useTileset is true (the default), Tile Objects will inherit the texture and any tile properties
from the tileset, and the local tile ID will be used as the texture frame. For the frame selection to work
you need to load the tileset texture as a spritesheet so its frame names match the local tile IDs.
For instance, a tileset tile
{ id: 3, type: 'treadmill', speed: 4 }
with gid 19 and an object
{ id: 7, gid: 19, speed: 5, rotation: 90 }
will be interpreted as
{ id: 7, gid: 19, speed: 5, rotation: 90, type: 'treadmill', texture: '[the tileset texture]', frame: 3 }
You can suppress this behavior by setting the boolean ignoreTileset for each config that should ignore
object gid tilesets.
You can set a container property in the config. If given, the new Game Object will be added to
the Container or Layer instance instead of the Scene.
You can set named texture- key and texture- frame properties, which will be set on the new Game Object.
Finally, you can provide an array of config objects, to convert multiple types of object in
a single call:
createFromObjects ( layerName , [
{
gid : 26 ,
classType : Coin
} ,
{
id : 9 ,
classType : BossMonster
} ,
{
name : 'lava' ,
classType : LavaTile
} ,
{
type : 'endzone' ,
classType : Phaser . GameObjects . Zone
}
] ) ;
The signature of this method changed significantly in v3.60.0. Prior to this, it did not take config objects.
Parameters:
name type optional default description
objectLayerName string No The name of the Tiled object layer to create the Game Objects from.
config Phaser.Types.Tilemaps.CreateFromObjectLayerConfig | Array.< Phaser.Types.Tilemaps.CreateFromObjectLayerConfig > No A CreateFromObjects configuration object, or an array of them.
useTileset boolean Yes true True if objects that set gids should also search the underlying tile for properties and data.
Returns: Array.< Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject > - An array containing the Game Objects that were created. Empty if invalid object layer, or no matching id/gid/name was found.

Since: 3.0.0
createFromTiles ​
<instance> createFromTiles(indexes, replacements, [spriteConfig], [scene], [camera], [layer]) ​
Description:
Creates a Sprite for every tile matching the given tile indexes in the layer. You can
optionally specify if each tile will be replaced with a new tile after the Sprite has been
created. Set this value to -1 if you want to just remove the tile after conversion.
This is useful if you want to lay down special tiles in a level that are converted to
Sprites, but want to replace the tile itself with a floor tile or similar once converted.
The following features were added in Phaser v3.80:
By default, Phaser Sprites have their origin set to 0.5 x 0.5. If you don't specify a new
origin in the spriteConfig, then it will adjust the sprite positions by half the tile size,
to position them accurately on the map.
When the Sprite is created it will copy the following properties from the tile:
'rotation', 'flipX', 'flipY', 'alpha', 'visible' and 'tint'.
The spriteConfig also has a special property called useSpriteSheet . If this is set to
true and you have loaded the tileset as a sprite sheet (not an image), then it will
set the Sprite key and frame to match the sprite texture and tile index.
Parameters:
name type optional description
indexes number | array No The tile index, or array of indexes, to create Sprites from.
replacements number | array No The tile index, or array of indexes, to change a converted tile to. Set to null to leave the tiles unchanged. If an array is given, it is assumed to be a one-to-one mapping with the indexes array.
spriteConfig Phaser.Types.GameObjects.Sprite.SpriteConfig Yes The config object to pass into the Sprite creator (i.e. scene.make.sprite).
scene Phaser.Scene Yes The Scene to create the Sprites within.
camera Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D.Camera Yes The Camera to use when calculating the tile index from the world values.
layer string | number Phaser.Tilemaps.TilemapLayer Yes
Returns: Array.< Phaser.GameObjects.Sprite > - Returns an array of Tiles, or null if the layer given was invalid.

looking in Tiled and looking at the layer name. Or you can open the JSON file it exports and
look at the layers[].name value. Either way it must match.
Prior to v3.50.0 this method was called createDynamicLayer .

setRenderOrder ​
<instance> setRenderOrder(renderOrder) ​
Description:
Sets the rendering (draw) order of the tiles in this map.
The default is 'right-down', meaning it will order the tiles starting from the top-left,
drawing to the right and then moving down to the next row.
The draw orders are:
0 = right-down
1 = left-down
2 = right-up
3 = left-up
Setting the render order does not change the tiles or how they are stored in the layer,
it purely impacts the order in which they are rendered.
You can provide either an integer (0 to 3), or the string version of the order.
Calling this method after creating Tilemap Layers will not automatically
update them to use the new render order. If you call this method after creating layers, use their
own setRenderOrder methods to change them as needed.
Parameters:
name type optional description
renderOrder number | string No The render (draw) order value. Either an integer between 0 and 3, or a string: 'right-down', 'left-down', 'right-up' or 'left-up'.
Returns: Phaser.Tilemaps.Tilemap - This Tilemap object.

tiles on this layer that have the same index. If a callback is already set for the tile index it
will be replaced. Set the callback to null to remove it. If you want to set a callback for a tile
at a specific location on the map then see setTileLocationCallback .
If no layer is specified, the maps current layer is used.
Parameters:
