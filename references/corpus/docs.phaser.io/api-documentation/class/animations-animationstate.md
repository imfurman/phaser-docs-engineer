AnimationState
The Animation State Component.
This component provides features to apply animations to Game Objects. It is responsible for
loading, queuing animations for later playback, mixing between animations and setting
the current animation frame to the Game Object that owns this component.
This component lives as an instance within any Game Object that has it defined, such as Sprites.
You can access its properties and methods via the anims property, i.e. Sprite.anims .
As well as playing animations stored in the global Animation Manager, this component
can also create animations that are stored locally within it. See the create method
for more details.
Prior to Phaser 3.50 this component was called just Animation and lived in the
Phaser.GameObjects.Components namespace. It was renamed to AnimationState
in 3.50 to help better identify its true purpose when browsing the documentation.

Public Methods ​
chain ​
<instance> chain([key]) ​
Description:
Sets an animation, or an array of animations, to be played in the future, after the current one completes or stops.
The current animation must enter a 'completed' state for this to happen, i.e. finish all of its repeats, delays, etc,
or have one of the stop methods called.
An animation set to repeat forever will never enter a completed state unless stopped.
You can chain a new animation at any point, including before the current one starts playing, during it, or when it ends (via its animationcomplete event).
Chained animations are specific to a Game Object, meaning different Game Objects can have different chained animations without impacting the global animation they're playing.
Call this method with no arguments to reset all currently chained animations.
Parameters:
name type optional description
key string | Phaser.Animations.Animation Phaser.Types.Animations.PlayAnimationConfig Array.<string>
Returns: Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject - The Game Object that owns this Animation Component.
Source: src/animations/AnimationState.js#L484
Since: 3.16.0
complete ​
<instance> complete() ​
Description:
The current animation has completed. This dispatches the ANIMATION_COMPLETE event.
This method is called by the Animation instance and should not usually be invoked directly.
If no animation is loaded, no events will be dispatched.
If another animation has been queued for playback, it will be started after the events fire.
Returns: Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject - The Game Object that owns this Animation Component.
Fires: Phaser.Animations.Events#event:ANIMATION_COMPLETE
Source: src/animations/AnimationState.js#L1309
Since: 3.50.0
create ​
<instance> create(config) ​
Description:
Creates a new Animation that is local specifically to this Sprite.
When a Sprite owns an animation, it is kept out of the global Animation Manager, which means
you're free to use keys that may be already defined there. Unless you specifically need a Sprite
to have a unique animation, you should favor using global animations instead, as they allow for
the same animation to be used across multiple Sprites, saving on memory. However, if this Sprite
is the only one to use this animation, it's sensible to create it here.
If an invalid key is given this method will return false .
If you pass the key of an animation that already exists locally, that animation will be returned.
A brand new animation is only created if the key is valid and not already in use by this Sprite.
If you wish to re-use an existing key, call the remove method first, then this method.
Parameters:
name type optional description
config Phaser.Types.Animations.Animation No The configuration settings for the Animation.
Returns: Phaser.Animations.Animation , false - The Animation that was created, or false if the key is already in use.
Source: src/animations/AnimationState.js#L1699
Since: 3.50.0
createFromAseprite ​
<instance> createFromAseprite(key, [tags]) ​
Description:
Create one, or more animations from a loaded Aseprite JSON file.
Aseprite is a powerful animated sprite editor and pixel art tool.
You can find more details at https://www.aseprite.org/
To export a compatible JSON file in Aseprite, please do the following:
Go to "File - Export Sprite Sheet"
On the Layout tab:
2a. Set the "Sheet type" to "Packed"
2b. Set the "Constraints" to "None"
2c. Check the "Merge Duplicates" checkbox
On the Sprite tab:
3a. Set "Layers" to "Visible layers"
3b. Set "Frames" to "All frames", unless you only wish to export a sub-set of tags
On the Borders tab:
4a. Check the "Trim Sprite" and "Trim Cells" options
4b. Ensure "Border Padding", "Spacing" and "Inner Padding" are all > 0 (1 is usually enough)
On the Output tab:
5a. Check "Output File", give your image a name and make sure you choose "png files" as the file type
5b. Check "JSON Data" and give your json file a name
5c. The JSON Data type can be either a Hash or Array, Phaser doesn't mind.
5d. Make sure "Tags" is checked in the Meta options
5e. In the "Item Filename" input box, make sure it says just "{frame}" and nothing more.
Click export
This was tested with Aseprite 1.2.25.
This will export a png and json file which you can load using the Aseprite Loader, i.e.:
function preload ( )
{
this . load . path = 'assets/animations/aseprite/' ;
this . load . aseprite ( 'paladin' , 'paladin.png' , 'paladin.json' ) ;
}
Once loaded, you can call this method on a Sprite with the 'atlas' key:
const sprite = this . add . sprite ( 400 , 300 ) ;
sprite . anims . createFromAseprite ( 'paladin' ) ;
Any animations defined in the JSON will now be available to use on this Sprite and you play them
via their Tag name. For example, if you have an animation called 'War Cry' on your Aseprite timeline,
you can play it on the Sprite using that Tag name:
const sprite = this . add . sprite ( 400 , 300 ) ;
sprite . anims . createFromAseprite ( 'paladin' ) ;
sprite . play ( 'War Cry' ) ;
When calling this method you can optionally provide an array of tag names, and only those animations
will be created. For example:
sprite . anims . createFromAseprite ( 'paladin' , [ 'step' , 'War Cry' , 'Magnum Break' ] ) ;
This will only create the 3 animations defined. Note that the tag names are case-sensitive.
Parameters:
name type optional description
key string No The key of the loaded Aseprite atlas. It must have been loaded prior to calling this method.
tags Array.<string> Yes An array of Tag names. If provided, only animations found in this array will be created.
Returns: Array.< Phaser.Animations.Animation > - An array of Animation instances that were successfully created.

generateFrameNames ​
<instance> generateFrameNames(key, [config]) ​
Description:
Generate an array of Phaser.Types.Animations.AnimationFrame objects from a texture key and configuration object.
Generates objects with string based frame names, as configured by the given Phaser.Types.Animations.GenerateFrameNames .
It's a helper method, designed to make it easier for you to extract all of the frame names from texture atlases.
If you're working with a sprite sheet, see the generateFrameNumbers method instead.
Example:
If you have a texture atlases loaded called gems and it contains 6 frames called ruby_0001 , ruby_0002 , and so on,
then you can call this method using: this.anims.generateFrameNames('gems', { prefix: 'ruby_', end: 6, zeroPad: 4 }) .
The end value tells it to look for 6 frames, incrementally numbered, all starting with the prefix ruby_ . The zeroPad
value tells it how many zeroes pad out the numbers. To create an animation using this method, you can do:
this . anims . create ( {
key : 'ruby' ,
repeat : - 1 ,
frames : this . anims . generateFrameNames ( 'gems' , {
prefix : 'ruby_' ,
end : 6 ,
zeroPad : 4
} )
} ) ;
Please see the animation examples for further details.
Parameters:
name type optional description
key string No The key for the texture containing the animation frames.
config Phaser.Types.Animations.GenerateFrameNames Yes The configuration object for the animation frame names.
Returns: Array.< Phaser.Types.Animations.AnimationFrame > - The array of {@link Phaser.Types.Animations.AnimationFrame} objects.

generateFrameNumbers ​
<instance> generateFrameNumbers(key, [config]) ​
Description:
Generate an array of Phaser.Types.Animations.AnimationFrame objects from a texture key and configuration object.
Generates objects with numbered frame names, as configured by the given Phaser.Types.Animations.GenerateFrameNumbers .
If you're working with a texture atlas, see the generateFrameNames method instead.
It's a helper method, designed to make it easier for you to extract frames from sprite sheets.
If you're working with a texture atlas, see the generateFrameNames method instead.
Example:
If you have a sprite sheet loaded called explosion and it contains 12 frames, then you can call this method using:
this.anims.generateFrameNumbers('explosion', { start: 0, end: 11 }) .
The end value tells it to stop after 12 frames. To create an animation using this method, you can do:
this . anims . create ( {
key : 'boom' ,
frames : this . anims . generateFrameNumbers ( 'explosion' , {
start : 0 ,
end : 11
} )
} ) ;
Note that start is optional and you don't need to include it if the animation starts from frame 0.
To specify an animation in reverse, swap the start and end values.
If the frames are not sequential, you may pass an array of frame numbers instead, for example:
this.anims.generateFrameNumbers('explosion', { frames: [ 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2 ] })
Please see the animation examples and GenerateFrameNumbers config docs for further details.

Source: src/animations/AnimationState.js#L644
Since: 3.0.0
play ​
<instance> play(key, [ignoreIfPlaying]) ​
Description:
Start playing the given animation on this Sprite.
Animations in Phaser can either belong to the global Animation Manager, or specifically to this Sprite.
The benefit of a global animation is that multiple Sprites can all play the same animation, without
having to duplicate the data. You can just create it once and then play it on any Sprite.
The following code shows how to create a global repeating animation. The animation will be created
from all of the frames within the sprite sheet that was loaded with the key 'muybridge':
var config = {
key : 'run' ,
frames : 'muybridge' ,
frameRate : 15 ,
repeat : - 1
} ;
// This code should be run from within a Scene:
this . anims . create ( config ) ;
However, if you wish to create an animation that is unique to this Sprite, and this Sprite alone,
you can call the Animation.create method instead. It accepts the exact same parameters as when
creating a global animation, however the resulting data is kept locally in this Sprite.
With the animation created, either globally or locally, you can now play it on this Sprite:
this . add . sprite ( x , y ) . play ( 'run' ) ;
Alternatively, if you wish to run it at a different frame rate, for example, you can pass a config
object instead:
this . add . sprite ( x , y ) . play ( { key : 'run' , frameRate : 24 } ) ;
When playing an animation on a Sprite it will first check to see if it can find a matching key
locally within the Sprite. If it can, it will play the local animation. If not, it will then
search the global Animation Manager and look for it there.
If you need a Sprite to be able to play both local and global animations, make sure they don't
have conflicting keys.
See the documentation for the PlayAnimationConfig config object for more details about this.
Also, see the documentation in the Animation Manager for further details on creating animations.
Parameters:
name type optional default description
key string | Phaser.Animations.Animation Phaser.Types.Animations.PlayAnimationConfig No
ignoreIfPlaying boolean Yes false If this animation is already playing then ignore this call.
Returns: Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject - The Game Object that owns this Animation Component.

playAfterDelay ​
<instance> playAfterDelay(key, delay) ​
Description:
Waits for the specified delay, in milliseconds, then starts playback of the given animation.
If the animation also has a delay value set in its config, it will be added to the delay given here.
If an animation is already running and a new animation is given to this method, it will wait for
the given delay before starting the new animation.
If no animation is currently running, the given one begins after the delay.
Prior to Phaser 3.50 this method was called 'delayedPlay' and the parameters were in the reverse order.
Parameters:
name type optional description
key string | Phaser.Animations.Animation Phaser.Types.Animations.PlayAnimationConfig No
delay number No The delay, in milliseconds, to wait before starting the animation playing.
Returns: Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject - The Game Object that owns this Animation Component.

playAfterRepeat ​
<instance> playAfterRepeat(key, [repeatCount]) ​
Description:
Waits for the current animation to complete the repeatCount number of repeat cycles, then starts playback
of the given animation.
You can use this to ensure there are no harsh jumps between two sets of animations, i.e. going from an
idle animation to a walking animation, by making them blend smoothly into each other.
If no animation is currently running, the given one will start immediately.
Parameters:
name type optional default description
key string | Phaser.Animations.Animation Phaser.Types.Animations.PlayAnimationConfig No
repeatCount number Yes 1 How many times should the animation repeat before the next one starts?

playReverse ​
<instance> playReverse(key, [ignoreIfPlaying]) ​
Description:
Start playing the given animation on this Sprite, in reverse.
Animations in Phaser can either belong to the global Animation Manager, or specifically to this Sprite.
The benefit of a global animation is that multiple Sprites can all play the same animation, without
having to duplicate the data. You can just create it once and then play it on any Sprite.
The following code shows how to create a global repeating animation. The animation will be created
from all of the frames within the sprite sheet that was loaded with the key 'muybridge':
var config = {
key : 'run' ,
frames : 'muybridge' ,
frameRate : 15 ,
repeat : - 1
} ;
// This code should be run from within a Scene:
this . anims . create ( config ) ;
However, if you wish to create an animation that is unique to this Sprite, and this Sprite alone,
you can call the Animation.create method instead. It accepts the exact same parameters as when
creating a global animation, however the resulting data is kept locally in this Sprite.
With the animation created, either globally or locally, you can now play it on this Sprite:
this . add . sprite ( x , y ) . playReverse ( 'run' ) ;
Alternatively, if you wish to run it at a different frame rate, for example, you can pass a config
object instead:
this . add . sprite ( x , y ) . playReverse ( { key : 'run' , frameRate : 24 } ) ;
When playing an animation on a Sprite it will first check to see if it can find a matching key
locally within the Sprite. If it can, it will play the local animation. If not, it will then
search the global Animation Manager and look for it there.
If you need a Sprite to be able to play both local and global animations, make sure they don't
have conflicting keys.
See the documentation for the PlayAnimationConfig config object for more details about this.
Also, see the documentation in the Animation Manager for further details on creating animations.
Parameters:
name type optional default description
key string | Phaser.Animations.Animation Phaser.Types.Animations.PlayAnimationConfig No
ignoreIfPlaying boolean Yes false If an animation is already playing then ignore this call.
Returns: Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject - The Game Object that owns this Animation Component.

previousFrame ​
<instance> previousFrame() ​
Description:
Advances the animation to the previous frame, regardless of the time or animation state.
If the animation is set to repeat, or yoyo, this will still take effect.
Calling this does not change the direction of the animation. I.e. if it was currently
playing in forwards, calling this method doesn't then change the direction to backwards.
Returns: Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject - The Game Object this Animation Component belongs to.

Since: 3.16.0
remove ​
<instance> remove(key) ​
Description:
Removes a locally created Animation from this Sprite, based on the given key.
Once an Animation has been removed, this Sprite cannot play it again without re-creating it.
Parameters:
name type optional description
key string No The key of the animation to remove.
Returns: Phaser.Animations.Animation - The Animation instance that was removed from this Sprite, if the key was valid.

restart ​
<instance> restart([includeDelay], [resetRepeats]) ​
Description:
Restarts the current animation from its beginning.
You can optionally reset the delay and repeat counters as well.
Calling this will fire the ANIMATION_RESTART event immediately.
If you includeDelay then it will also fire the ANIMATION_START event once
the delay has expired, otherwise, playback will just begin immediately.
Parameters:
name type optional default description
includeDelay boolean Yes false Whether to include the delay value of the animation when restarting.
resetRepeats boolean Yes false Whether to reset the repeat counter or not?
Returns: Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject - The Game Object that owns this Animation Component.

setProgress ​
<instance> setProgress([value]) ​
Description:
Takes a value between 0 and 1 and uses it to set how far this animation is through playback.
Does not factor in repeats or yoyos, but does handle playing forwards or backwards.
The value is based on the current frame and how far that is in the animation, it is not based on
the duration of the animation.
Parameters:
name type optional default description
value number Yes 0 The progress value, between 0 and 1.
Returns: Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject - The Game Object that owns this Animation Component.
Source: src/animations/AnimationState.js#L1180
Since: 3.4.0
setRepeat ​
<instance> setRepeat(value) ​
Description:
Sets the number of times that the animation should repeat after its first play through.
For example, if repeat is 1, the animation will play a total of twice: the initial play plus 1 repeat.
To repeat indefinitely, use -1.
The value should always be an integer.
Calling this method only works if the animation is already running. Otherwise, any
value specified here will be overwritten when the next animation loads in. To avoid this,
use the repeat property of the PlayAnimationConfig object instead.
Parameters:
name type optional description
value number No The number of times that the animation should repeat.
Returns: Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject - The Game Object that owns this Animation Component.
