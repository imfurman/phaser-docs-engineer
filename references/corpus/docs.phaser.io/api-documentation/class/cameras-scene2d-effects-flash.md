Flash
A Camera Flash effect.
This effect will flash the camera viewport to the given color, over the duration specified.
Only the camera viewport is flashed. None of the objects it is displaying are impacted, i.e. their colors do
not change.
The effect will dispatch several events on the Camera itself and you can also specify an onUpdate callback,
which is invoked each frame for the duration of the effect, if required.
