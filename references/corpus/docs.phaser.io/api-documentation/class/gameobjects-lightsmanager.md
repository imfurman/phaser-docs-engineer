Public Methods ​
addLight ​
<instance> addLight([x], [y], [radius], [rgb], [intensity]) ​
Description:
Add a Light.
Parameters:
name type optional default description
x number Yes 0 The horizontal position of the Light.
y number Yes 0 The vertical position of the Light.
radius number Yes 128 The radius of the Light.
rgb number Yes "0xffffff" The integer RGB color of the light.
intensity number Yes 1 The intensity of the Light.
Returns: Phaser.GameObjects.Light - The Light that was added.
Source: src/gameobjects/lights/LightsManager.js#L273
Since: 3.0.0
addPointLight ​
<instance> addPointLight(x, y, [color], [radius], [intensity], [attenuation]) ​
Description:
Creates a new Point Light Game Object and adds it to the Scene.
Note: This method will only be available if the Point Light Game Object has been built into Phaser.
The Point Light Game Object provides a way to add a point light effect into your game,
without the expensive shader processing requirements of the traditional Light Game Object.
The difference is that the Point Light renders using a custom shader, designed to give the
impression of a point light source, of variable radius, intensity and color, in your game.
However, unlike the Light Game Object, it does not impact any other Game Objects, or use their
normal maps for calcuations. This makes them extremely fast to render compared to Lights
and perfect for special effects, such as flickering torches or muzzle flashes.
For maximum performance you should batch Point Light Game Objects together. This means
ensuring they follow each other consecutively on the display list. Ideally, use a Layer
Game Object and then add just Point Lights to it, so that it can batch together the rendering
of the lights. You don't have to do this, and if you've only a handful of Point Lights in
your game then it's perfectly safe to mix them into the display list as normal. However, if
you're using a large number of them, please consider how they are mixed into the display list.
The renderer will automatically cull Point Lights. Those with a radius that does not intersect
with the Camera will be skipped in the rendering list. This happens automatically and the
culled state is refreshed every frame, for every camera.
The origin of a Point Light is always 0.5 and it cannot be changed.
Point Lights are a WebGL only feature and do not have a Canvas counterpart.
Parameters:
name type optional default description
x number No The horizontal position of this Point Light in the world.
y number No The vertical position of this Point Light in the world.
color number Yes "0xffffff" The color of the Point Light, given as a hex value.
radius number Yes 128 The radius of the Point Light.
intensity number Yes 1 The intensity, or color blend, of the Point Light.
attenuation number Yes 0.1 The attenuation of the Point Light. This is the reduction of light from the center point.
Returns: Phaser.GameObjects.PointLight - The Game Object that was created.

destroy ​
<instance> destroy() ​
Description:
Destroy the Lights Manager.
Cleans up all references by calling Phaser.GameObjects.LightsManager#shutdown .

Since: 3.0.0
disable ​
<instance> disable() ​
Description:
Disable the Lights Manager.
Returns: Phaser.GameObjects.LightsManager - This Lights Manager instance.
Source: src/gameobjects/lights/LightsManager.js#L157
Since: 3.0.0
enable ​
<instance> enable() ​
Description:
Enable the Lights Manager.
Returns: Phaser.GameObjects.LightsManager - This Lights Manager instance.
Source: src/gameobjects/lights/LightsManager.js#L137
Since: 3.0.0
getLightCount ​
<instance> getLightCount() ​
Description:
Get the number of Lights managed by this Lights Manager.
Returns: number - The number of Lights managed by this Lights Manager.
Source: src/gameobjects/lights/LightsManager.js#L260
Since: 3.0.0
getLights ​
<instance> getLights(camera) ​
Description:
Get all lights that can be seen by the given Camera.
It will automatically cull lights that are outside the world view of the Camera.
If more lights are returned than supported by the pipeline, the lights are then culled
based on the distance from the center of the camera. Only those closest are rendered.
Parameters:
name type optional description
camera Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D.Camera No The Camera to cull Lights for.
Returns: Array.< Phaser.GameObjects.Light > - The culled Lights.
Source: src/gameobjects/lights/LightsManager.js#L172
Since: 3.50.0
getMaxVisibleLights ​
<instance> getMaxVisibleLights() ​
Description:
Returns the maximum number of Lights allowed to appear at once.
Returns: number - The maximum number of Lights allowed to appear at once.
Source: src/gameobjects/lights/LightsManager.js#L247
Since: 3.0.0
removeLight ​
<instance> removeLight(light) ​
Description:
Remove a Light.
Parameters:
name type optional description
light Phaser.GameObjects.Light No The Light to remove.
Returns: Phaser.GameObjects.LightsManager - This Lights Manager instance.
Source: src/gameobjects/lights/LightsManager.js#L304
Since: 3.0.0
setAmbientColor ​
<instance> setAmbientColor(rgb) ​
Description:
Set the ambient light color.
Parameters:
name type optional description
rgb number No The integer RGB color of the ambient light.

shutdown ​
<instance> shutdown() ​
Description:
Shut down the Lights Manager.
Recycles all active Lights into the Light pool, resets ambient light color and clears the lists of Lights and
culled Lights.
