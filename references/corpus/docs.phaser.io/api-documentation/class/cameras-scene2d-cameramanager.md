CameraManager
The Camera Manager is a plugin that belongs to a Scene and is responsible for managing all of the Scene Cameras.
By default you can access the Camera Manager from within a Scene using this.cameras , although this can be changed
in your game config.
Create new Cameras using the add method. Or extend the Camera class with your own addition code and then add
the new Camera in using the addExisting method.
Cameras provide a view into your game world, and can be positioned, rotated, zoomed and scrolled accordingly.
A Camera consists of two elements: The viewport and the scroll values.
The viewport is the physical position and size of the Camera within your game. Cameras, by default, are
created the same size as your game, but their position and size can be set to anything. This means if you
wanted to create a camera that was 320x200 in size, positioned in the bottom-right corner of your game,
you'd adjust the viewport to do that (using methods like setViewport and setSize ).
If you wish to change where the Camera is looking in your game, then you scroll it. You can do this
via the properties scrollX and scrollY or the method setScroll . Scrolling has no impact on the
viewport, and changing the viewport has no impact on the scrolling.
By default a Camera will render all Game Objects it can see. You can change this using the ignore method,
allowing you to filter Game Objects out on a per-Camera basis. The Camera Manager can manage up to 31 unique
'Game Object ignore capable' Cameras. Any Cameras beyond 31 that you create will all be given a Camera ID of
zero, meaning that they cannot be used for Game Object exclusion. This means if you need your Camera to ignore
Game Objects, make sure it's one of the first 31 created.
A Camera also has built-in special effects including Fade, Flash, Camera Shake, Pan and Zoom.

Public Members ​
cameras ​
cameras: Array.< Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D.Camera > ​
Description:
An Array of the Camera objects being managed by this Camera Manager.
The Cameras are updated and rendered in the same order in which they appear in this array.
Do not directly add or remove entries to this array. However, you can move the contents
around the array should you wish to adjust the display order.

default ​
default: Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D.Camera ​
Description:
A default un-transformed Camera that doesn't exist on the camera list and doesn't
count towards the total number of cameras being managed. It exists for other
systems, as well as your own code, should they require a basic un-transformed
camera instance from which to calculate a view matrix.

Since: 3.17.0
main ​
main: Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D.Camera ​
Description:
A handy reference to the 'main' camera. By default this is the first Camera the
Camera Manager creates. You can also set it directly, or use the makeMain argument
in the add and addExisting methods. It allows you to access it from your game:
var cam = this . cameras . main ;
Also see the properties camera1 , camera2 and so on.

Since: 3.0.0
roundPixels ​
roundPixels: boolean ​
Description:
All Cameras created by, or added to, this Camera Manager, will have their roundPixels
property set to match this value. By default it is set to match the value set in the
game configuration, but can be changed at any point. Equally, individual cameras can
also be changed as needed.

Public Methods ​
add ​
<instance> add([x], [y], [width], [height], [makeMain], [name]) ​
Description:
Adds a new Camera into the Camera Manager. The Camera Manager can support up to 31 different Cameras.
Each Camera has its own viewport, which controls the size of the Camera and its position within the canvas.
Use the Camera.scrollX and Camera.scrollY properties to change where the Camera is looking, or the
Camera methods such as centerOn . Cameras also have built in special effects, such as fade, flash, shake,
pan and zoom.
By default Cameras are transparent and will render anything that they can see based on their scrollX
and scrollY values. Game Objects can be set to be ignored by a Camera by using the Camera.ignore method.
The Camera will have its roundPixels property set to whatever CameraManager.roundPixels is. You can change
it after creation if required.
See the Camera class documentation for more details.
Parameters:
name type optional default description
x number Yes 0 The horizontal position of the Camera viewport.
y number Yes 0 The vertical position of the Camera viewport.
width number Yes The width of the Camera viewport. If not given it'll be the game config size.
height number Yes The height of the Camera viewport. If not given it'll be the game config size.
makeMain boolean Yes false Set this Camera as being the 'main' camera. This just makes the property main a reference to it.
name string Yes "''" The name of the Camera.
Returns: Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D.Camera - The newly created Camera.
Source: src/cameras/2d/CameraManager.js#L205
Since: 3.0.0
addExisting ​
<instance> addExisting(camera, [makeMain]) ​
Description:
Adds an existing Camera into the Camera Manager.
The Camera should either be a Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D.Camera instance, or a class that extends from it.
The Camera will have its roundPixels property set to whatever CameraManager.roundPixels is. You can change
it after addition if required.
The Camera will be assigned an ID, which is used for Game Object exclusion and then added to the
manager. As long as it doesn't already exist in the manager it will be added then returned.
If this method returns null then the Camera already exists in this Camera Manager.
Parameters:
name type optional default description
camera Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D.Camera No The Camera to be added to the Camera Manager.
makeMain boolean Yes false Set this Camera as being the 'main' camera. This just makes the property main a reference to it.
Returns: Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D.Camera - The Camera that was added to the Camera Manager, or null if it couldn't be added.
