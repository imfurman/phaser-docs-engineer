TweenManager
The Tween Manager is a default Scene Plugin which controls and updates Tweens.
A tween is a way to alter one or more properties of a target object over a defined period of time.
Tweens are created by calling the add method and passing in the configuration object.
const logo = this . add . image ( 100 , 100 , 'logo' ) ;
this . tweens . add ( {
targets : logo ,
x : 600 ,
ease : 'Power1' ,
duration : 2000
} ) ;
See the TweenBuilderConfig for all of the options you have available.
Playback will start immediately unless the tween has been configured to be paused.
Please note that a Tween will not manipulate any target property that begins with an underscore.
Tweens are designed to be 'fire-and-forget'. They automatically destroy themselves once playback
is complete, to free-up memory and resources. If you wish to keep a tween after playback, i.e. to
play it again at a later time, then you should set the persist property to true in the config.
However, doing so means it's entirely up to you to destroy the tween when you're finished with it,
otherwise it will linger in memory forever.
If you wish to chain Tweens together for sequential playback, see the TweenManager.chain method.

A Number Tween is a special kind of tween that doesn't have a target. Instead,
it allows you to tween between 2 numeric values. The default values are
0 and 1 , but you can change them via the from and to properties.
You can get the current tweened value via the Tween.getValue() method.
Playback will start immediately unless the tween has been configured to be paused.

Please note that a Tween will not manipulate any target property that begins with an underscore.
Tweens are designed to be 'fire-and-forget'. They automatically destroy themselves once playback
is complete, to free-up memory and resources. If you wish to keep a tween after playback, i.e. to
play it again at a later time, then you should set the persist property to true in the config.
However, doing so means it's entirely up to you to destroy the tween when you're finished with it,
otherwise it will linger in memory forever.

The tweens are played in order, from start to finish. You can optionally set the chain
to repeat as many times as you like. Once the chain has finished playing, or repeating if set,
all tweens in the chain will be destroyed automatically. To override this, set the persist
argument to 'true'.
Playback will start immediately unless the first Tween has been configured to be paused.

Since: 3.0.0
setFps ​
<instance> setFps([fps]) ​
Description:
Limits the Tween system to run at a particular frame rate.
You should not set this above the frequency of the browser,
but instead can use it to throttle the frame rate lower, should
you need to in certain situations.
Parameters:
name type optional default description
fps number Yes 240 The frame rate to tick at.
Returns: Phaser.Tweens.TweenManager - This Tween Manager instance.
Source: src/tweens/TweenManager.js#L606
Since: 3.60.0
setGlobalTimeScale ​
<instance> setGlobalTimeScale(value) ​
Description:
Sets a new scale of the time delta for this Tween Manager.
The time delta is the time elapsed between two consecutive frames and influences the speed of time for this Tween Manager and all Tweens it owns. Values higher than 1 increase the speed of time, while values smaller than 1 decrease it. A value of 0 freezes time and is effectively equivalent to pausing all Tweens.
Parameters:
name type optional description
value number No The new scale of the time delta, where 1 is the normal speed.
Returns: Phaser.Tweens.TweenManager - This Tween Manager instance.
Source: src/tweens/TweenManager.js#L962

setLagSmooth ​
<instance> setLagSmooth([limit], [skip]) ​
Description:
Set the limits that are used when a browser encounters lag, or delays that cause the elapsed
time between two frames to exceed the expected amount. If this occurs, the Tween Manager will
act as if the 'skip' amount of times has passed, in order to maintain strict tween sequencing.
This is enabled by default with the values 500ms for the lag limit and 33ms for the skip.
You should not set these to low values, as it won't give time for the browser to ever
catch-up with itself and reclaim sync.
Call this method with no arguments to disable smoothing.
Call it with the arguments 500 and 33 to reset to the defaults.
Parameters:
name type optional default description
limit number Yes 0 If the browser exceeds this amount, in milliseconds, it will act as if the 'skip' amount has elapsed instead.
skip number Yes 0 The amount, in milliseconds, to use as the step delta should the browser lag beyond the 'limit'.
Returns: Phaser.Tweens.TweenManager - This Tween Manager instance.
Source: src/tweens/TweenManager.js#L573
Since: 3.60.0
shutdown ​
<instance> shutdown() ​

Source: src/tweens/TweenManager.js#L1116
Since: 3.0.0
stagger ​
<instance> stagger(value, config) ​
Description:
Creates a Stagger function to be used by a Tween property.
The stagger function will allow you to stagger changes to the value of the property across all targets of the tween.
This is only worth using if the tween has multiple targets.
The following will stagger the delay by 100ms across all targets of the tween, causing them to scale down to 0.2
over the duration specified:
this . tweens . add ( {
targets : [ ... ] ,
scale : 0.2 ,
ease : 'linear' ,
duration : 1000 ,
delay : this . tweens . stagger ( 100 )
} ) ;
The following will stagger the delay by 500ms across all targets of the tween using a 10 x 6 grid, staggering
from the center out, using a cubic ease.
this . tweens . add ( {
targets : [ ... ] ,
scale : 0.2 ,
ease : 'linear' ,
duration : 1000 ,
delay : this . tweens . stagger ( 500 , { grid : [ 10 , 6 ] , from : 'center' , ease : 'cubic.out' } )
} ) ;
Parameters:
name type optional description
value number | Array.<number> No The amount to stagger by, or an array containing two elements representing the min and max values to stagger between.
