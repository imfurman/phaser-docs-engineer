File
The base File class used by all File Types that the Loader can support.
You shouldn't create an instance of a File directly, but should extend it with your own class, setting a custom type and processing methods.

Parameters
name type optional description
loader Phaser.Loader.LoaderPlugin No The Loader that is going to load this File.
fileConfig Phaser.Types.Loader.FileConfig No The file configuration object, as created by the file type.
