Polygon
A Polygon object
The polygon is a closed shape consists of a series of connected straight lines defined by list of ordered points.
Several formats are supported to define the list of points, check the setTo method for details.
This is a geometry object allowing you to define and inspect the shape.
It is not a Game Object, in that you cannot add it to the display list, and it has no texture.
To render a Polygon you should look at the capabilities of the Graphics class.

Earcut ​
<static> Earcut(data, [holeIndices], [dimensions]) ​
Description:
This module implements a modified ear slicing algorithm, optimized by z-order curve hashing and extended to
handle holes, twisted polygons, degeneracies and self-intersections in a way that doesn't guarantee correctness
of triangulation, but attempts to always produce acceptable results for practical data.
Example:
const triangles = Phaser . Geom . Polygon . Earcut ( [ 10 , 0 , 0 , 50 , 60 , 60 , 70 , 10 ] ) ; // returns [1,0,3, 3,2,1]
Each group of three vertex indices in the resulting array forms a triangle.
// triangulating a polygon with a hole
earcut ( [ 0 , 0 , 100 , 0 , 100 , 100 , 0 , 100 , 20 , 20 , 80 , 20 , 80 , 80 , 20 , 80 ] , [ 4 ] ) ;
// [3,0,4, 5,4,0, 3,4,7, 5,0,1, 2,3,7, 6,5,1, 2,7,6, 6,1,2]
// triangulating a polygon with 3d coords
earcut ( [ 10 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 50 , 2 , 60 , 60 , 3 , 70 , 10 , 4 ] , null , 3 ) ;
// [1,0,3, 3,2,1]
If you pass a single vertex as a hole, Earcut treats it as a Steiner point.
If your input is a multi-dimensional array (e.g. GeoJSON Polygon), you can convert it to the format
expected by Earcut with Phaser.Geom.Polygon.Earcut.flatten :
var data = earcut . flatten ( geojson . geometry . coordinates ) ;
var triangles = earcut ( data . vertices , data . holes , data . dimensions ) ;
After getting a triangulation, you can verify its correctness with Phaser.Geom.Polygon.Earcut.deviation :
var deviation = earcut . deviation ( vertices , holes , dimensions , triangles ) ;
Returns the relative difference between the total area of triangles and the area of the input polygon.
0 means the triangulation is fully correct.

Parameters:
name type optional default description
data Array.<number> No A flat array of vertex coordinate, like [x0,y0, x1,y1, x2,y2, ...]
holeIndices Array.<number> Yes An array of hole indices if any (e.g. [5, 8] for a 12-vertex input would mean one hole with vertices 5–7 and another with 8–11).
dimensions number Yes 2 The number of coordinates per vertex in the input array (2 by default).
Returns: Array.<number> - An array of triangulated data.
