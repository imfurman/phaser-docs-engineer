Class
TextureManager
Version: Phaser v3.90.0
On this page
TextureManager
When Phaser boots it will create an instance of this Texture Manager class.
It is a global manager that handles all textures in your game. You can access it from within
a Scene via the this.textures property.
Its role is as a manager for all textures that your game uses. It can create, update and remove
textures globally, as well as parse texture data from external files, such as sprite sheets
and texture atlases.
Sprites and other texture-based Game Objects get their texture data directly from this class.

within this object. Therefore, you can access any texture directly from this
object without any iteration.
You should not typically modify this object directly, but instead use the
methods provided by the Texture Manager to add and remove entries from it.

addDynamicTexture ​
<instance> addDynamicTexture(key, [width], [height]) ​
Description:
Creates a Dynamic Texture instance and adds itself to this Texture Manager.
A Dynamic Texture is a special texture that allows you to draw textures, frames and most kind of
Game Objects directly to it.
You can take many complex objects and draw them to this one texture, which can then be used as the
base texture for other Game Objects, such as Sprites. Should you then update this texture, all
Game Objects using it will instantly be updated as well, reflecting the changes immediately.
It's a powerful way to generate dynamic textures at run-time that are WebGL friendly and don't invoke
expensive GPU uploads on each change.
See the methods available on the DynamicTexture class for more details.
Optionally, you can also pass a Dynamic Texture instance to this method to have
it added to the Texture Manager.
Parameters:
name type optional default description
key string | Phaser.Textures.DynamicTexture No The string-based key of this Texture. Must be unique within the Texture Manager. Or, a DynamicTexture instance.
width number Yes 256 The width of this Dynamic Texture in pixels. Defaults to 256 x 256. Ignored if an instance is passed as the key.
height number Yes 256 The height of this Dynamic Texture in pixels. Defaults to 256 x 256. Ignored if an instance is passed as the key.
Returns: Phaser.Textures.DynamicTexture - The Dynamic Texture that was created, or null if the key is already in use.
Fires: Phaser.Textures.Events#event:ADD
Source: src/textures/TextureManager.js#L747
Since: 3.60.0
addGLTexture ​
<instance> addGLTexture(key, glTexture) ​
Description:
Takes a WebGLTextureWrapper and creates a Phaser Texture from it, which is added to the Texture Manager using the given key.
This allows you to then use the Texture as a normal texture for texture based Game Objects like Sprites.
This is a WebGL only feature.
Prior to Phaser 3.80.0, this method took a bare WebGLTexture
as the glTexture parameter. You must now wrap the WebGLTexture in a
WebGLTextureWrapper instance before passing it to this method.
Parameters:
name type optional description
key string No The unique string-based key of the Texture.
glTexture Phaser.Renderer.WebGL.Wrappers.WebGLTextureWrapper No The source Render Texture.
Returns: Phaser.Textures.Texture - The Texture that was created, or null if the key is already in use.

Since: 3.12.0
addSpriteSheet ​
<instance> addSpriteSheet(key, source, config, [dataSource]) ​
Description:
Adds a Sprite Sheet to this Texture Manager.
In Phaser terminology a Sprite Sheet is a texture containing different frames, but each frame is the exact
same size and cannot be trimmed or rotated. This is different to a Texture Atlas, created by tools such as
Texture Packer, and more akin with the fixed-frame exports you get from apps like Aseprite or old arcade
games.
As of Phaser 3.60 you can use this method to add a sprite sheet to an existing Phaser Texture.
Parameters:

generate ​
<instance> generate(key, config) ​
Description:
Creates a new Texture using the given config values.
Generated textures consist of a Canvas element to which the texture data is drawn.
Generates a texture based on the given Create configuration object.
The texture is drawn using a fixed-size indexed palette of 16 colors, where the hex value in the
data cells map to a single color. For example, if the texture config looked like this:
var star = [
'.....828.....' ,
'....72227....' ,
'....82228....' ,
'...7222227...' ,
'2222222222222' ,
'8222222222228' ,
'.72222222227.' ,
'..787777787..' ,
'..877777778..' ,
'.78778887787.' ,
'.27887.78872.' ,
'.787.....787.'
] ;
this . textures . generate ( 'star' , { data : star , pixelWidth : 4 } ) ;
Then it would generate a texture that is 52 x 48 pixels in size, because each cell of the data array
represents 1 pixel multiplied by the pixelWidth value. The cell values, such as 8 , maps to color
number 8 in the palette. If a cell contains a period character . then it is transparent.
The default palette is Arne16, but you can specify your own using the palette property.

name type optional description
key string No The unique string-based key of the Texture.
config Phaser.Types.Create.GenerateTextureConfig No The configuration object needed to generate the texture.
Returns: Phaser.Textures.Texture - The Texture that was created, or null if the key is already in use.
