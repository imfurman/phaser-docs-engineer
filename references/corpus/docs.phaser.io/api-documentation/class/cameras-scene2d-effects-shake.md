Shake
A Camera Shake effect.
This effect will shake the camera viewport by a random amount, bounded by the specified intensity, each frame.
Only the camera viewport is moved. None of the objects it is displaying are impacted, i.e. their positions do
not change.
The effect will dispatch several events on the Camera itself and you can also specify an onUpdate callback,
which is invoked each frame for the duration of the effect if required.
Constructor
new Shake(camera)
Parameters
name type optional description
camera Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D.Camera No The camera this effect is acting upon.
Scope : static

duration ​
duration: number ​
Description:
The duration of the effect, in milliseconds.

intensity ​
intensity: Phaser.Math.Vector2 ​
Description:
The intensity of the effect. Use small float values. The default when the effect starts is 0.05.
This is a Vector2 object, allowing you to control the shake intensity independently across x and y.
You can modify this value while the effect is active to create more varied shake effects.

start ​
<instance> start([duration], [intensity], [force], [callback], [context]) ​
Description:
Shakes the Camera by the given intensity over the duration specified.
Parameters:
name type optional default description
duration number Yes 100 The duration of the effect in milliseconds.
intensity number | Phaser.Math.Vector2 Yes 0.05 The intensity of the shake.
force boolean Yes false Force the shake effect to start immediately, even if already running.
callback Phaser.Types.Cameras.Scene2D.CameraShakeCallback Yes This callback will be invoked every frame for the duration of the effect. It is sent two arguments: A reference to the camera and a progress amount between 0 and 1 indicating how complete the effect is.
context any Yes The context in which the callback is invoked. Defaults to the Scene to which the Camera belongs.
Returns: Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D.Camera - The Camera on which the effect was started.
Fires: Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D.Events#event:SHAKE_START , Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D.Events#event:SHAKE_COMPLETE
