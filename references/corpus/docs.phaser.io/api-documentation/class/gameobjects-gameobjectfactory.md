GameObjectFactory
The Game Object Factory is a Scene plugin that allows you to quickly create many common
types of Game Objects and have them automatically registered with the Scene.
Game Objects directly register themselves with the Factory and inject their own creation
methods into the class.
Constructor
new GameObjectFactory(scene)
Parameters
name type optional description
scene Phaser.Scene No The Scene to which this Game Object Factory belongs.
Scope : static

Public Methods ​
arc ​
<instance> arc([x], [y], [radius], [startAngle], [endAngle], [anticlockwise], [fillColor], [fillAlpha]) ​
Description:
Creates a new Arc Shape Game Object and adds it to the Scene.
Note: This method will only be available if the Arc Game Object has been built into Phaser.
The Arc Shape is a Game Object that can be added to a Scene, Group or Container. You can
treat it like any other Game Object in your game, such as tweening it, scaling it, or enabling
it for input or physics. It provides a quick and easy way for you to render this shape in your
game without using a texture, while still taking advantage of being fully batched in WebGL.
This shape supports both fill and stroke colors.
When it renders it displays an arc shape. You can control the start and end angles of the arc,
as well as if the angles are winding clockwise or anti-clockwise. With the default settings
it renders as a complete circle. By changing the angles you can create other arc shapes,
such as half-circles.
Parameters:
name type optional default description
x number Yes 0 The horizontal position of this Game Object in the world.
y number Yes 0 The vertical position of this Game Object in the world.
radius number Yes 128 The radius of the arc.
startAngle number Yes 0 The start angle of the arc, in degrees.
endAngle number Yes 360 The end angle of the arc, in degrees.
anticlockwise boolean Yes false The winding order of the start and end angles.
fillColor number Yes The color the arc will be filled with, i.e. 0xff0000 for red.
fillAlpha number Yes The alpha the arc will be filled with. You can also set the alpha of the overall Shape using its alpha property.
Returns: Phaser.GameObjects.Arc - The Game Object that was created.

bitmapMask ​
<instance> bitmapMask([maskObject], [x], [y], [texture], [frame]) ​
Description:
A Bitmap Mask combines the alpha (opacity) of a masked pixel with the alpha of another pixel.
Unlike the Geometry Mask, which is a clipping path, a Bitmap Mask behaves like an alpha mask,
not a clipping path. It is only available when using the WebGL Renderer.
A Bitmap Mask can use any Game Object, or Dynamic Texture, to determine the alpha of each pixel of the masked Game Object(s).
For any given point of a masked Game Object's texture, the pixel's alpha will be multiplied by the alpha
of the pixel at the same position in the Bitmap Mask's Game Object. The color of the pixel from the
Bitmap Mask doesn't matter.
For example, if a pure blue pixel with an alpha of 0.95 is masked with a pure red pixel with an
alpha of 0.5, the resulting pixel will be pure blue with an alpha of 0.475. Naturally, this means
that a pixel in the mask with an alpha of 0 will hide the corresponding pixel in all masked Game Objects
A pixel with an alpha of 1 in the masked Game Object will receive the same alpha as the
corresponding pixel in the mask.
Note: You cannot combine Bitmap Masks and Blend Modes on the same Game Object. You can, however,
combine Geometry Masks and Blend Modes together.
The Bitmap Mask's location matches the location of its Game Object, not the location of the
masked objects. Moving or transforming the underlying Game Object will change the mask
(and affect the visibility of any masked objects), whereas moving or transforming a masked object
will not affect the mask.
The Bitmap Mask will not render its Game Object by itself. If the Game Object is not in a
Scene's display list, it will only be used for the mask and its full texture will not be directly
visible. Adding the underlying Game Object to a Scene will not cause any problems - it will
render as a normal Game Object and will also serve as a mask.
Parameters:
name type optional description
maskObject Phaser.GameObjects.GameObject | Phaser.Textures.DynamicTexture Yes The Game Object or Texture that will be used as the mask. If null it will generate an Image Game Object using the rest of the arguments.
x number Yes If creating a Game Object, the horizontal position in the world.
y number Yes If creating a Game Object, the vertical position in the world.
texture string | Phaser.Textures.Texture Yes If creating a Game Object, the key, or instance of the Texture it will use to render with, as stored in the Texture Manager.
frame string | number Phaser.Textures.Frame Yes
Returns: Phaser.Display.Masks.BitmapMask - The Bitmap Mask that was created.

bitmapText ​
<instance> bitmapText(x, y, font, [text], [size], [align]) ​
Description:
Creates a new Bitmap Text Game Object and adds it to the Scene.
BitmapText objects work by taking a texture file and an XML or JSON file that describes the font structure.
During rendering for each letter of the text is rendered to the display, proportionally spaced out and aligned to
match the font structure.
BitmapText objects are less flexible than Text objects, in that they have less features such as shadows, fills and the ability
to use Web Fonts, however you trade this flexibility for rendering speed. You can also create visually compelling BitmapTexts by
processing the font texture in an image editor, applying fills and any other effects required.
To create multi-line text insert \r, \n or \r\n escape codes into the text string.
To create a BitmapText data files you need a 3rd party app such as:
BMFont (Windows, free): http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/
Glyph Designer (OS X, commercial): http://www.71squared.com/en/glyphdesigner
Littera (Web-based, free): http://kvazars.com/littera/
For most use cases it is recommended to use XML. If you wish to use JSON, the formatting should be equal to the result of
converting a valid XML file through the popular X2JS library. An online tool for conversion can be found here: http://codebeautify.org/xmltojson
Note: This method will only be available if the Bitmap Text Game Object has been built into Phaser.
Parameters:
name type optional default description
x number No The x position of the Game Object.
y number No The y position of the Game Object.
font string No The key of the font to use from the BitmapFont cache.
text string | Array.<string> Yes The string, or array of strings, to be set as the content of this Bitmap Text.
size number Yes The font size to set.
align number Yes 0 The alignment of the text in a multi-line BitmapText object.
Returns: Phaser.GameObjects.BitmapText - The Game Object that was created.

curve ​
<instance> curve([x], [y], [curve], [fillColor], [fillAlpha]) ​
Description:
Creates a new Curve Shape Game Object and adds it to the Scene.
Note: This method will only be available if the Curve Game Object has been built into Phaser.
The Curve Shape is a Game Object that can be added to a Scene, Group or Container. You can
treat it like any other Game Object in your game, such as tweening it, scaling it, or enabling
it for input or physics. It provides a quick and easy way for you to render this shape in your
game without using a texture, while still taking advantage of being fully batched in WebGL.
This shape supports both fill and stroke colors.
To render a Curve Shape you must first create a Phaser.Curves.Curve object, then pass it to
the Curve Shape in the constructor.
The Curve shape also has a smoothness property and corresponding setSmoothness method.
This allows you to control how smooth the shape renders in WebGL, by controlling the number of iterations
that take place during construction. Increase and decrease the default value for smoother, or more
jagged, shapes.
Parameters:
name type optional default description
x number Yes 0 The horizontal position of this Game Object in the world.
y number Yes 0 The vertical position of this Game Object in the world.
curve Phaser.Curves.Curve Yes The Curve object to use to create the Shape.

dom ​
<instance> dom(x, y, [element], [style], [innerText]) ​
Description:
DOM Element Game Objects are a way to control and manipulate HTML Elements over the top of your game.
In order for DOM Elements to display you have to enable them by adding the following to your game
configuration object:
dom {
createContainer : true
}
When this is added, Phaser will automatically create a DOM Container div that is positioned over the top
of the game canvas. This div is sized to match the canvas, and if the canvas size changes, as a result of
settings within the Scale Manager, the dom container is resized accordingly.
You can create a DOM Element by either passing in DOMStrings, or by passing in a reference to an existing
Element that you wish to be placed under the control of Phaser. For example:
this . add . dom ( x , y , 'div' , 'background-color: lime; width: 220px; height: 100px; font: 48px Arial' , 'Phaser' ) ;
The above code will insert a div element into the DOM Container at the given x/y coordinate. The DOMString in
the 4th argument sets the initial CSS style of the div and the final argument is the inner text. In this case,
it will create a lime colored div that is 220px by 100px in size with the text Phaser in it, in an Arial font.
You should nearly always, without exception, use explicitly sized HTML Elements, in order to fully control
alignment and positioning of the elements next to regular game content.
Rather than specify the CSS and HTML directly you can use the load.html File Loader to load it into the
cache and then use the createFromCache method instead. You can also use createFromHTML and various other
methods available in this class to help construct your elements.
Once the element has been created you can then control it like you would any other Game Object. You can set its
position, scale, rotation, alpha and other properties. It will move as the main Scene Camera moves and be clipped
at the edge of the canvas. It's important to remember some limitations of DOM Elements: The obvious one is that
they appear above or below your game canvas. You cannot blend them into the display list, meaning you cannot have
a DOM Element, then a Sprite, then another DOM Element behind it.
They also cannot be enabled for input. To do that, you have to use the addListener method to add native event
listeners directly. The final limitation is to do with cameras. The DOM Container is sized to match the game canvas
entirely and clipped accordingly. DOM Elements respect camera scrolling and scrollFactor settings, but if you
change the size of the camera so it no longer matches the size of the canvas, they won't be clipped accordingly.
Also, all DOM Elements are inserted into the same DOM Container, regardless of which Scene they are created in.
DOM Elements are a powerful way to align native HTML with your Phaser Game Objects. For example, you can insert
a login form for a multiplayer game directly into your title screen. Or a text input box for a highscore table.
Or a banner ad from a 3rd party service. Or perhaps you'd like to use them for high resolution text display and
UI. The choice is up to you, just remember that you're dealing with standard HTML and CSS floating over the top
of your game, and should treat it accordingly.
Note: This method will only be available if the DOM Element Game Object has been built into Phaser.
Parameters:
name type optional description
x number No The horizontal position of this DOM Element in the world.
y number No The vertical position of this DOM Element in the world.
element HTMLElement | string Yes An existing DOM element, or a string. If a string starting with a # it will do a getElementById look-up on the string (minus the hash). Without a hash, it represents the type of element to create, i.e. 'div'.
style string | any Yes If a string, will be set directly as the elements style property value. If a plain object, will be iterated and the values transferred. In both cases the values replacing whatever CSS styles may have been previously set.
innerText string Yes If given, will be set directly as the elements innerText property value, replacing whatever was there before.
Returns: Phaser.GameObjects.DOMElement - The Game Object that was created.

dynamicBitmapText ​
<instance> dynamicBitmapText(x, y, font, [text], [size]) ​
Description:
Creates a new Dynamic Bitmap Text Game Object and adds it to the Scene.
BitmapText objects work by taking a texture file and an XML or JSON file that describes the font structure.
During rendering for each letter of the text is rendered to the display, proportionally spaced out and aligned to
match the font structure.
Dynamic Bitmap Text objects are different from Static Bitmap Text in that they invoke a callback for each
letter being rendered during the render pass. This callback allows you to manipulate the properties of
each letter being rendered, such as its position, scale or tint, allowing you to create interesting effects
like jiggling text, which can't be done with Static text. This means that Dynamic Text takes more processing
time, so only use them if you require the callback ability they have.
BitmapText objects are less flexible than Text objects, in that they have less features such as shadows, fills and the ability
to use Web Fonts, however you trade this flexibility for rendering speed. You can also create visually compelling BitmapTexts by
processing the font texture in an image editor, applying fills and any other effects required.
To create multi-line text insert \r, \n or \r\n escape codes into the text string.
To create a BitmapText data files you need a 3rd party app such as:

A Line Shape allows you to draw a line between two points in your game. You can control the
stroke color and thickness of the line. In WebGL only you can also specify a different
thickness for the start and end of the line, allowing you to render lines that taper-off.
If you need to draw multiple lines in a sequence you may wish to use the Polygon Shape instead.
Parameters:
name type optional default description
x number Yes 0 The horizontal position of this Game Object in the world.
y number Yes 0 The vertical position of this Game Object in the world.
x1 number Yes 0 The horizontal position of the start of the line.
y1 number Yes 0 The vertical position of the start of the line.
x2 number Yes 128 The horizontal position of the end of the line.
y2 number Yes 0 The vertical position of the end of the line.
strokeColor number Yes The color the line will be drawn in, i.e. 0xff0000 for red.
strokeAlpha number Yes The alpha the line will be drawn in. You can also set the alpha of the overall Shape using its alpha property.
Returns: Phaser.GameObjects.Line - The Game Object that was created.

nineslice ​
<instance> nineslice(x, y, texture, [frame], [width], [height], [leftWidth], [rightWidth], [topHeight], [bottomHeight]) ​
Description:
A Nine Slice Game Object allows you to display a texture-based object that
can be stretched both horizontally and vertically, but that retains
fixed-sized corners. The dimensions of the corners are set via the
parameters to this class.
This is extremely useful for UI and button like elements, where you need
them to expand to accommodate the content without distorting the texture.
The texture you provide for this Game Object should be based on the
following layout structure:
A B
+---+----------------------+---+
C | 1 | 2 | 3 |
+---+----------------------+---+
| | | |
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
| | | |
+---+----------------------+---+
D | 7 | 8 | 9 |
+---+----------------------+---+
When changing this objects width and / or height:
areas 1, 3, 7 and 9 (the corners) will remain unscaled
areas 2 and 8 will be stretched horizontally only
areas 4 and 6 will be stretched vertically only
area 5 will be stretched both horizontally and vertically
You can also create a 3 slice Game Object:
This works in a similar way, except you can only stretch it horizontally.
Therefore, it requires less configuration:
A B
+---+----------------------+---+
| | | |
C | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| | | |
+---+----------------------+---+
When changing this objects width (you cannot change its height)
areas 1 and 3 will remain unscaled
area 2 will be stretched horizontally
The above configuration concept is adapted from the Pixi NineSlicePlane.
To specify a 3 slice object instead of a 9 slice you should only
provide the leftWidth and rightWidth parameters. To create a 9 slice
you must supply all parameters.
The minimum width this Game Object can be is the total of
leftWidth + rightWidth . The minimum height this Game Object
can be is the total of topHeight + bottomHeight .
If you need to display this object at a smaller size, you can scale it.
In terms of performance, using a 3 slice Game Object is the equivalent of
having 3 Sprites in a row. Using a 9 slice Game Object is the equivalent
of having 9 Sprites in a row. The vertices of this object are all batched
together and can co-exist with other Sprites and graphics on the display
list, without incurring any additional overhead.
As of Phaser 3.60 this Game Object is WebGL only.

pointlight ​
<instance> pointlight(x, y, [color], [radius], [intensity], [attenuation]) ​
Description:
Creates a new Point Light Game Object and adds it to the Scene.
Note: This method will only be available if the Point Light Game Object has been built into Phaser.
The Point Light Game Object provides a way to add a point light effect into your game,
without the expensive shader processing requirements of the traditional Light Game Object.
The difference is that the Point Light renders using a custom shader, designed to give the
impression of a point light source, of variable radius, intensity and color, in your game.
However, unlike the Light Game Object, it does not impact any other Game Objects, or use their
normal maps for calcuations. This makes them extremely fast to render compared to Lights
and perfect for special effects, such as flickering torches or muzzle flashes.
For maximum performance you should batch Point Light Game Objects together. This means
ensuring they follow each other consecutively on the display list. Ideally, use a Layer
Game Object and then add just Point Lights to it, so that it can batch together the rendering
of the lights. You don't have to do this, and if you've only a handful of Point Lights in
your game then it's perfectly safe to mix them into the display list as normal. However, if
you're using a large number of them, please consider how they are mixed into the display list.
The renderer will automatically cull Point Lights. Those with a radius that does not intersect
with the Camera will be skipped in the rendering list. This happens automatically and the
culled state is refreshed every frame, for every camera.
The origin of a Point Light is always 0.5 and it cannot be changed.
Point Lights are a WebGL only feature and do not have a Canvas counterpart.
Parameters:
name type optional default description
x number No The horizontal position of this Point Light in the world.
y number No The vertical position of this Point Light in the world.
color number Yes "0xffffff" The color of the Point Light, given as a hex value.
radius number Yes 128 The radius of the Point Light.
intensity number Yes 1 The intensity, or color blend, of the Point Light.
attenuation number Yes 0.1 The attenuation of the Point Light. This is the reduction of light from the center point.
Returns: Phaser.GameObjects.PointLight - The Game Object that was created.

polygon ​
<instance> polygon([x], [y], [points], [fillColor], [fillAlpha]) ​
Description:
Creates a new Polygon Shape Game Object and adds it to the Scene.
Note: This method will only be available if the Polygon Game Object has been built into Phaser.
The Polygon Shape is a Game Object that can be added to a Scene, Group or Container. You can
treat it like any other Game Object in your game, such as tweening it, scaling it, or enabling
it for input or physics. It provides a quick and easy way for you to render this shape in your
game without using a texture, while still taking advantage of being fully batched in WebGL.
This shape supports both fill and stroke colors.
The Polygon Shape is created by providing a list of points, which are then used to create an
internal Polygon geometry object. The points can be set from a variety of formats:
An array of Point or Vector2 objects: [new Phaser.Math.Vector2(x1, y1), ...]
An array of objects with public x/y properties: [obj1, obj2, ...]
An array of paired numbers that represent point coordinates: [x1,y1, x2,y2, ...]
An array of arrays with two elements representing x/y coordinates: [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...]
By default the x and y coordinates of this Shape refer to the center of it. However, depending
on the coordinates of the points provided, the final shape may be rendered offset from its origin.
Parameters:
name type optional default description
x number Yes 0 The horizontal position of this Game Object in the world.
y number Yes 0 The vertical position of this Game Object in the world.
points any Yes The points that make up the polygon.
fillColor number Yes The color the polygon will be filled with, i.e. 0xff0000 for red.

renderTexture ​
<instance> renderTexture(x, y, [width], [height]) ​
Description:
Creates a new Render Texture Game Object and adds it to the Scene.
Note: This method will only be available if the Render Texture Game Object has been built into Phaser.
A Render Texture is a combination of Dynamic Texture and an Image Game Object, that uses the
Dynamic Texture to display itself with.
A Dynamic Texture is a special texture that allows you to draw textures, frames and most kind of
Game Objects directly to it.
You can take many complex objects and draw them to this one texture, which can then be used as the
base texture for other Game Objects, such as Sprites. Should you then update this texture, all
Game Objects using it will instantly be updated as well, reflecting the changes immediately.
It's a powerful way to generate dynamic textures at run-time that are WebGL friendly and don't invoke
expensive GPU uploads on each change.
Parameters:
name type optional default description
x number No The horizontal position of this Game Object in the world.
y number No The vertical position of this Game Object in the world.
width number Yes 32 The width of the Render Texture.
height number Yes 32 The height of the Render Texture.

text ​
<instance> text(x, y, text, [style]) ​
Description:
Creates a new Text Game Object and adds it to the Scene.
A Text Game Object.
Text objects work by creating their own internal hidden Canvas and then renders text to it using
the standard Canvas fillText API. It then creates a texture from this canvas which is rendered
to your game during the render pass.
Because it uses the Canvas API you can take advantage of all the features this offers, such as
applying gradient fills to the text, or strokes, shadows and more. You can also use custom fonts
loaded externally, such as Google or TypeKit Web fonts.
You can only display fonts that are currently loaded and available to the browser: therefore fonts must
be pre-loaded. Phaser does not do this for you, so you will require the use of a 3rd party font loader,
or have the fonts ready available in the CSS on the page in which your Phaser game resides.
See this for the available default fonts
across mobile browsers.
A note on performance: Every time the contents of a Text object changes, i.e. changing the text being
displayed, or the style of the text, it needs to remake the Text canvas, and if on WebGL, re-upload the
new texture to the GPU. This can be an expensive operation if used often, or with large quantities of
Text objects in your game. If you run into performance issues you would be better off using Bitmap Text
instead, as it benefits from batching and avoids expensive Canvas API calls.
Note: This method will only be available if the Text Game Object has been built into Phaser.
Parameters:
name type optional description
x number No The horizontal position of this Game Object in the world.
y number No The vertical position of this Game Object in the world.
text string | Array.<string> No The text this Text object will display.
style Phaser.Types.GameObjects.Text.TextStyle Yes The Text style configuration object.

tilemap ​
<instance> tilemap([key], [tileWidth], [tileHeight], [width], [height], [data], [insertNull]) ​
Description:
Creates a Tilemap from the given key or data, or creates a blank Tilemap if no key/data provided.
When loading from CSV or a 2D array, you should specify the tileWidth & tileHeight. When parsing
from a map from Tiled, the tileWidth, tileHeight, width & height will be pulled from the map
data. For an empty map, you should specify tileWidth, tileHeight, width & height.
Parameters:
name type optional default description
key string Yes The key in the Phaser cache that corresponds to the loaded tilemap data.
tileWidth number Yes 32 The width of a tile in pixels. Pass in null to leave as the default.
tileHeight number Yes 32 The height of a tile in pixels. Pass in null to leave as the default.
width number Yes 10 The width of the map in tiles. Pass in null to leave as the default.
height number Yes 10 The height of the map in tiles. Pass in null to leave as the default.
data Array.<Array.<number>> Yes Instead of loading from the cache, you can also load directly from a 2D array of tile indexes. Pass in null for no data.
insertNull boolean Yes false Controls how empty tiles, tiles with an index of -1, in the map data are handled. If true , empty locations will get a value of null . If false , empty location will get a Tile object with an index of -1. If you've a large sparsely populated map and the tile data doesn't need to change then setting this value to true will help with memory consumption. However if your map is small or you need to update the tiles dynamically, then leave the default value set.
Returns: Phaser.Tilemaps.Tilemap - undefined

timeline ​
<instance> timeline(config) ​
Description:
A Timeline is a way to schedule events to happen at specific times in the future.
You can think of it as an event sequencer for your game, allowing you to schedule the
running of callbacks, events and other actions at specific times in the future.
A Timeline is a Scene level system, meaning you can have as many Timelines as you like, each
belonging to a different Scene. You can also have multiple Timelines running at the same time.
If the Scene is paused, the Timeline will also pause. If the Scene is destroyed, the Timeline
will be automatically destroyed. However, you can control the Timeline directly, pausing,
resuming and stopping it at any time.
Create an instance of a Timeline via the Game Object Factory:
const timeline = this . add . timeline ( ) ;
The Timeline always starts paused. You must call play on it to start it running.
You can also pass in a configuration object on creation, or an array of them:
const timeline = this . add . timeline ( {
at : 1000 ,
run : ( ) => {
this . add . sprite ( 400 , 300 , 'logo' ) ;
}
} ) ;
timeline . play ( ) ;
In this example we sequence a few different events:
const timeline = this . add . timeline ( [
{
at : 1000 ,
run : ( ) => { this . logo = this . add . sprite ( 400 , 300 , 'logo' ) ; } ,
sound : 'TitleMusic'
} ,
{
at : 2500 ,
tween : {
targets : this . logo ,
y : 600 ,
yoyo : true
} ,
sound : 'Explode'
} ,
{
at : 8000 ,
event : 'HURRY_PLAYER' ,
target : this . background ,
set : {
tint : 0xff0000
}
}
] ) ;
timeline . play ( ) ;
The Timeline can also be looped with the repeat method:
timeline . repeat ( ) . play ( ) ;
There are lots of options available to you via the configuration object. See the
Phaser.Types.Time.TimelineEventConfig typedef for more details.
Parameters:
name type optional description
config Phaser.Types.Time.TimelineEventConfig | Array.< Phaser.Types.Time.TimelineEventConfig > No The configuration object for this Timeline Event, or an array of them.
Returns: Phaser.Time.Timeline - The Timeline that was created.

tween ​
<instance> tween(config) ​
Description:
Creates a new Tween object.
Note: This method will only be available if Tweens have been built into Phaser.

Since: 3.0.0
tweenchain ​
<instance> tweenchain(config) ​
Description:
Creates a new TweenChain object and adds it to the Tween Manager.
Note: This method will only be available if Tweens have been built into Phaser.
Parameters:
name type optional description
config Phaser.Types.Tweens.TweenBuilderConfig | object No The TweenChain configuration.
Returns: Phaser.Tweens.TweenChain - The TweenChain that was created.

Since: 3.60.0
video ​
<instance> video(x, y, [key]) ​
Description:
Creates a new Video Game Object and adds it to the Scene.
This Game Object is capable of handling playback of a video file, video stream or media stream.
You can optionally 'preload' the video into the Phaser Video Cache:
preload ( ) {
this . load . video ( 'ripley' , 'assets/aliens.mp4' ) ;
}
create ( ) {
this . add . video ( 400 , 300 , 'ripley' ) ;
}
You don't have to 'preload' the video. You can also play it directly from a URL:
create ( ) {
this . add . video ( 400 , 300 ) . loadURL ( 'assets/aliens.mp4' ) ;
}
To all intents and purposes, a video is a standard Game Object, just like a Sprite. And as such, you can do
all the usual things to it, such as scaling, rotating, cropping, tinting, making interactive, giving a
physics body, etc.
Transparent videos are also possible via the WebM file format. Providing the video file has was encoded with
an alpha channel, and providing the browser supports WebM playback (not all of them do), then it will render
in-game with full transparency.
Autoplaying Videos ​
Videos can only autoplay if the browser has been unlocked with an interaction, or satisfies the MEI settings.
The policies that control autoplaying are vast and vary between browser. You can, and should, read more about
it here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Autoplay_guide
If your video doesn't contain any audio, then set the noAudio parameter to true when the video is loaded ,
and it will often allow the video to play immediately:
preload ( ) {
this . load . video ( 'pixar' , 'nemo.mp4' , true ) ;
}
The 3rd parameter in the load call tells Phaser that the video doesn't contain any audio tracks. Video without
audio can autoplay without requiring a user interaction. Video with audio cannot do this unless it satisfies
the browsers MEI settings. See the MDN Autoplay Guide for further details.
Or:
create ( ) {
this . add . video ( 400 , 300 ) . loadURL ( 'assets/aliens.mp4' , true ) ;
}
You can set the noAudio parameter to true even if the video does contain audio. It will still allow the video
to play immediately, but the audio will not start.
Note that due to a bug in IE11 you cannot play a video texture to a Sprite in WebGL. For IE11 force Canvas mode.
More details about video playback and the supported media formats can be found on MDN:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats
Note: This method will only be available if the Video Game Object has been built into Phaser.
Parameters:
name type optional description
x number No The horizontal position of this Game Object in the world.
y number No The vertical position of this Game Object in the world.
key string Yes Optional key of the Video this Game Object will play, as stored in the Video Cache.
Returns: Phaser.GameObjects.Video - The Game Object that was created.
