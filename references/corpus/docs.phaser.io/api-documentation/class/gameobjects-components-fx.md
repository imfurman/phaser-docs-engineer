FX
The FX Component features a set of methods used for applying a range of special built-in effects to a Game Object.
The effects include the following:
Barrel Distortion
Bloom
Blur
Bokeh / Tilt Shift
Circle Outline
Color Matrix
Glow
Displacement
Gradient
Pixelate
Shine
Shadow
Vignette
Wipe / Reveal
All Game Objects support Post FX. These are effects applied after the Game Object has been rendered.
Texture-based Game Objects also support Pre FX, including:
Image
Sprite
TileSprite
Text
RenderTexture
Video
And any Game Object that extends the above.
The difference between Pre FX and Post FX are that all Post FX take place in a canvas (renderer) sized frame buffer,
after the Game Object has been rendered. Pre FX, however, take place in a texture sized frame buffer, which is sized
based on the Game Object itself. The end result is then composited back to the main game canvas. For intensive effects,
such as blur, bloom or glow, which can require many iterations, this is a much more efficient way to apply the effect,
as only it only has to work on a Game Object sized texture and not all pixels in the canvas.
In short, you should always try and use a Pre FX if you can.
Due to the way that FX work they can be stacked-up. For example, you can apply a blur to a Game Object, then apply
a bloom effect to the same Game Object. The bloom effect will be applied to the blurred texture, not the original.
Keep the order in mind when stacking effects.
All effects are WebGL only and do not have canvas counterparts.
As you can appreciate, some effects are more expensive than others. For example, a bloom effect is going to be more
expensive than a simple color matrix effect, so please consider using them wisely and performance test your target
platforms early on in production.
This component is created automatically by the PostPipeline class and does not need to be instantiated directly.

addBokeh ​
<instance> addBokeh([radius], [amount], [contrast]) ​
Description:
Adds a Bokeh effect.
Bokeh refers to a visual effect that mimics the photographic technique of creating a shallow depth of field.
This effect is used to emphasize the game's main subject or action, by blurring the background or foreground
elements, resulting in a more immersive and visually appealing experience. It is achieved through rendering
techniques that simulate the out-of-focus areas, giving a sense of depth and realism to the game's graphics.
See also Tilt Shift.

Description:
Adds a Circle effect.
This effect will draw a circle around the texture of the Game Object, effectively masking off
any area outside of the circle without the need for an actual mask. You can control the thickness
of the circle, the color of the circle and the color of the background, should the texture be
transparent. You can also control the feathering applied to the circle, allowing for a harsh or soft edge.
Please note that adding this effect to a Game Object will not change the input area or physics body of
the Game Object, should it have one.
Parameters:
name type optional default description
thickness number Yes 8 The width of the circle around the texture, in pixels.
color number Yes "0xfeedb6" The color of the circular ring, given as a number value.
backgroundColor number Yes "0xff0000" The color of the background, behind the texture, given as a number value.
