MouseManager
The Mouse Manager is a helper class that belongs to the Input Manager.
Its role is to listen for native DOM Mouse Events and then pass them onto the Input Manager for further processing.
You do not need to create this class directly, the Input Manager will create an instance of it automatically.

Since: 3.0.0
releasePointerLock ​
<instance> releasePointerLock() ​
Description:
If the browser supports pointer lock, this will request that the pointer lock is released. If
the browser successfully enters a locked state, a 'POINTER_LOCK_CHANGE_EVENT' will be
dispatched - from the game's input manager - with an isPointerLocked property.
Source: src/input/mouse/MouseManager.js#L329
Since: 3.0.0
requestPointerLock ​
<instance> requestPointerLock() ​
Description:
If the browser supports it, you can request that the pointer be locked to the browser window.
This is classically known as 'FPS controls', where the pointer can't leave the browser until
the user presses an exit key.
If the browser successfully enters a locked state, a POINTER_LOCK_CHANGE_EVENT will be dispatched,
from the games Input Manager, with an isPointerLocked property.
It is important to note that pointer lock can only be enabled after an 'engagement gesture',
see: https://w3c.github.io/pointerlock/#dfn-engagement-gesture.
Note for Firefox: There is a bug in certain Firefox releases that cause native DOM events like
mousemove to fire continuously when in pointer lock mode. You can get around this by setting
this.preventDefaultMove to false in this class. You may also need to do the same for
preventDefaultDown and/or preventDefaultUp . Please test combinations of these if you encounter
the error.
