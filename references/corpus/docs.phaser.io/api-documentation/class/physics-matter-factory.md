Factory
The Matter Factory is responsible for quickly creating a variety of different types of
bodies, constraints and Game Objects and adding them into the physics world.
You access the factory from within a Scene using add :
this . matter . add . rectangle ( x , y , width , height ) ;
Use of the Factory is optional. All of the objects it creates can also be created
directly via your own code or constructors. It is provided as a means to keep your
code concise.

constraint ​
<instance> constraint(bodyA, bodyB, [length], [stiffness], [options]) ​
Description:
Constraints (or joints) are used for specifying that a fixed distance must be maintained
between two bodies, or a body and a fixed world-space position.
The stiffness of constraints can be modified to create springs or elastic.
To simulate a revolute constraint (or pin joint) set length: 0 and a high stiffness
value (e.g. 0.7 or above).
If the constraint is unstable, try lowering the stiffness value and / or increasing
constraintIterations within the Matter Config.
For compound bodies, constraints must be applied to the parent body and not one of its parts.
Parameters:
name type optional default description
bodyA MatterJS.BodyType No The first possible Body that this constraint is attached to.
bodyB MatterJS.BodyType No The second possible Body that this constraint is attached to.
length number Yes A Number that specifies the target resting length of the constraint. If not given it is calculated automatically in Constraint.create from initial positions of the constraint.bodyA and constraint.bodyB .
stiffness number Yes 1 A Number that specifies the stiffness of the constraint, i.e. the rate at which it returns to its resting constraint.length . A value of 1 means the constraint should be very stiff. A value of 0.2 means the constraint acts as a soft spring.
options Phaser.Types.Physics.Matter.MatterConstraintConfig Yes An optional Constraint configuration object that is used to set initial Constraint properties on creation.
Returns: MatterJS.ConstraintType - A Matter JS Constraint.

The stiffness of constraints can be modified to create springs or elastic.
To simulate a revolute constraint (or pin joint) set length: 0 and a high stiffness

For compound bodies, constraints must be applied to the parent body and not one of its parts.

sprite ​
<instance> sprite(x, y, key, [frame], [options]) ​
Description:
Creates a Matter Physics Sprite Game Object.
A Sprite Game Object is used for the display of both static and animated images in your game.
Sprites can have input events and physics bodies. They can also be tweened, tinted, scrolled
and animated.
The main difference between a Sprite and an Image Game Object is that you cannot animate Images.
As such, Sprites take a fraction longer to process and have a larger API footprint due to the Animation
Component. If you do not require animation then you can safely use Images to replace Sprites in all cases.

y number No The vertical position of this Game Object in the world.
key string No The key of the Texture this Game Object will use to render with, as stored in the Texture Manager.

Description:
Creates a wrapper around a Tile that provides access to a corresponding Matter body. A tile can only
have one Matter body associated with it. You can either pass in an existing Matter body for
the tile or allow the constructor to create the corresponding body for you. If the Tile has a
collision group (defined in Tiled), those shapes will be used to create the body. If not, the
tile's rectangle bounding box will be used.
The corresponding body will be accessible on the Tile itself via Tile.physics.matterBody.
Note: not all Tiled collision shapes are supported. See
Phaser.Physics.Matter.TileBody#setFromTileCollision for more information.
Parameters:
name type optional description

value (e.g. 0.7 or above).
If the constraint is unstable, try lowering the stiffness value and / or increasing
