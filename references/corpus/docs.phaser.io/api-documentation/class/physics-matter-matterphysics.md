MatterPhysics
The Phaser Matter plugin provides the ability to use the Matter JS Physics Engine within your Phaser games.
Unlike Arcade Physics, the other physics system provided with Phaser, Matter JS is a full-body physics system.
It features:
Rigid bodies
Compound bodies
Composite bodies
Concave and convex hulls
Physical properties (mass, area, density etc.)
Restitution (elastic and inelastic collisions)
Collisions (broad-phase, mid-phase and narrow-phase)
Stable stacking and resting
Conservation of momentum
Friction and resistance
Constraints
Gravity
Sleeping and static bodies
Rounded corners (chamfering)
Views (translate, zoom)
Collision queries (raycasting, region tests)
Time scaling (slow-mo, speed-up)
Configuration of Matter is handled via the Matter World Config object, which can be passed in either the
Phaser Game Config, or Phaser Scene Config. Here is a basic example:
physics : {
default : 'matter' ,
matter : {
enableSleeping : true ,
gravity : {
y : 0
} ,
debug : {
showBody : true ,
showStaticBody : true
}
}
}
This class acts as an interface between a Phaser Scene and a single instance of the Matter Engine.
Use it to access the most common Matter features and helper functions.
You can find details, documentation and examples on the Matter JS website: https://brm.io/matter-js/

add ​
add: Phaser.Physics.Matter.Factory ​
Description:
An instance of the Matter Factory. This class provides lots of functions for creating a
wide variety of physics objects and adds them automatically to the Matter World.
You can use this class to cut-down on the amount of code required in your game, however,
use of the Factory is entirely optional and should be seen as a development aid. It's
perfectly possible to create and add components to the Matter world without using it.

Public Methods ​
alignBody ​
<instance> alignBody(body, x, y, align) ​
Description:
Aligns a Body, or Matter Game Object, against the given coordinates.
The alignment takes place using the body bounds, which take into consideration things
like body scale and rotation.
Although a Body has a position property, it is based on the center of mass for the body,
not a dimension based center. This makes aligning bodies difficult, especially if they have
rotated or scaled. This method will derive the correct position based on the body bounds and
its center of mass offset, in order to align the body with the given coordinate.
For example, if you wanted to align a body so it sat in the bottom-center of the
Scene, and the world was 800 x 600 in size:
this . matter . alignBody ( body , 400 , 600 , Phaser . Display . Align . BOTTOM_CENTER ) ;
You pass in 400 for the x coordinate, because that is the center of the world, and 600 for
the y coordinate, as that is the base of the world.
Parameters:
name type optional description
body Phaser.Types.Physics.Matter.MatterBody No The Body to align.
x number No The horizontal position to align the body to.
y number No The vertical position to align the body to.
align number No One of the Phaser.Display.Align constants, such as Phaser.Display.Align.TOP_LEFT .

step ​
<instance> step([delta], [correction]) ​
Description:
Manually advances the physics simulation by one iteration.
You can optionally pass in the delta and correction values to be used by Engine.update.
If undefined they use the Matter defaults of 60Hz and no correction.
Calling step directly bypasses any checks of enabled or autoUpdate .
It also ignores any custom getDelta functions, as you should be passing the delta
value in to this call.
You can adjust the number of iterations that Engine.update performs internally.
Use the Scene Matter Physics config object to set the following properties:
positionIterations (defaults to 6)
velocityIterations (defaults to 4)
constraintIterations (defaults to 2)
Adjusting these values can help performance in certain situations, depending on the physics requirements
of your game.
Parameters:
name type optional default description
delta number Yes 16.666 The delta value.
correction number Yes 1 Optional delta correction value.
