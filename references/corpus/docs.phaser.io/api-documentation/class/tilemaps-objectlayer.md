ObjectLayer
A class for representing a Tiled object layer in a map. This mirrors the structure of a Tiled
object layer, except:
"x" & "y" properties are ignored since these cannot be changed in Tiled.
"offsetx" & "offsety" are applied to the individual object coordinates directly, so they
are ignored as well.
"draworder" is ignored.
Constructor
new ObjectLayer([config])
Parameters
name type optional description
config Phaser.Types.Tilemaps.ObjectLayerConfig Yes The data for the layer from the Tiled JSON object.

objects ​
objects: Array.< Phaser.Types.Tilemaps.TiledObject > ​
Description:
An array of all objects on this Object Layer.
Each Tiled object corresponds to a JavaScript object in this array. It has an id (unique),
name (as assigned in Tiled), type (as assigned in Tiled), rotation (in clockwise degrees),
properties (if any), visible state ( true if visible, false otherwise),
x and y coordinates (in pixels, relative to the tilemap), and a width and height (in pixels).
An object tile has a gid property (GID of the represented tile), a flippedHorizontal property,
a flippedVertical property, and flippedAntiDiagonal property.
The {@link http://docs.mapeditor.org/en/latest/reference/tmx-map-format/ |Tiled documentation} contains
information on flipping and rotation.
Polylines have a polyline property, which is an array of objects corresponding to points,
where each point has an x property and a y property. Polygons have an identically structured
array in their polygon property. Text objects have a text property with the text's properties.
Rectangles and ellipses have a rectangle or ellipse property set to true .
