ScaleManager
The Scale Manager handles the scaling, resizing and alignment of the game canvas.
The way scaling is handled is by setting the game canvas to a fixed size, which is defined in the
game configuration. You also define the parent container in the game config. If no parent is given,
it will default to using the document body. The Scale Manager will then look at the available space
within the parent and scale the canvas accordingly. Scaling is handled by setting the canvas CSS
width and height properties, leaving the width and height of the canvas element itself untouched.
Scaling is therefore achieved by keeping the core canvas the same size and 'stretching'
it via its CSS properties. This gives the same result and speed as using the transform-scale CSS
property, without the need for browser prefix handling.
The calculations for the scale are heavily influenced by the bounding parent size, which is the computed
dimensions of the canvas's parent. The CSS rules of the parent element play an important role in the
operation of the Scale Manager. For example, if the parent has no defined width or height, then actions
like auto-centering will fail to achieve the required result. The Scale Manager works in tandem with the
CSS you set-up on the page hosting your game, rather than taking control of it.
Parent and Display canvas containment guidelines: ​
Style the Parent element (of the game canvas) to control the Parent size and thus the games size and layout.
The Parent element's CSS styles should effectively apply maximum (and minimum) bounding behavior.
The Parent element should not apply a padding as this is not accounted for.
If a padding is required apply it to the Parent's parent or apply a margin to the Parent.
If you need to add a border, margin or any other CSS around your game container, then use a parent element and
apply the CSS to this instead, otherwise you'll be constantly resizing the shape of the game container.
The Display canvas layout CSS styles (i.e. margins, size) should not be altered / specified as
they may be updated by the Scale Manager.
Scale Modes ​
The way the scaling is handled is determined by the scaleMode property. The default is NONE ,
which prevents Phaser from scaling or touching the canvas, or its parent, at all. In this mode, you are
responsible for all scaling. The other scaling modes afford you automatic scaling.
If you wish to scale your game so that it always fits into the available space within the parent, you
should use the scale mode FIT . Look at the documentation for other scale modes to see what options are
available. Here is a basic config showing how to set this scale mode:
scale : {
parent : 'yourgamediv' ,
mode : Phaser . Scale . FIT ,
width : 800 ,
height : 600
}
Place the scale config object within your game config.
If you wish for the canvas to be resized directly, so that the canvas itself fills the available space
(i.e. it isn't scaled, it's resized) then use the RESIZE scale mode. This will give you a 1:1 mapping
of canvas pixels to game size. In this mode CSS isn't used to scale the canvas, it's literally adjusted
to fill all available space within the parent. You should be extremely careful about the size of the
canvas you're creating when doing this, as the larger the area, the more work the GPU has to do and it's
very easy to hit fill-rate limits quickly.
For complex, custom-scaling requirements, you should probably consider using the RESIZE scale mode,
with your own limitations in place re: canvas dimensions and managing the scaling with the game scenes
yourself. For the vast majority of games, however, the FIT mode is likely to be the most used.
Please appreciate that the Scale Manager cannot perform miracles. All it does is scale your game canvas
as best it can, based on what it can infer from its surrounding area. There are all kinds of environments
where it's up to you to guide and help the canvas position itself, especially when built into rendering
frameworks like React and Vue. If your page requires meta tags to prevent user scaling gestures, or such
like, then it's up to you to ensure they are present in the html.
Centering ​
You can also have the game canvas automatically centered. Again, this relies heavily on the parent being
properly configured and styled, as the centering offsets are based entirely on the available space
within the parent element. Centering is disabled by default, or can be applied horizontally, vertically,
or both. Here's an example:
scale : {
parent : 'yourgamediv' ,
autoCenter : Phaser . Scale . CENTER_BOTH ,
width : 800 ,
height : 600
}
Fullscreen API ​
If the browser supports it, you can send your game into fullscreen mode. In this mode, the game will fill
the entire display, removing all browser UI and anything else present on the screen. It will remain in this
mode until your game either disables it, or until the user tabs out or presses ESCape if on desktop. It's a
great way to achieve a desktop-game like experience from the browser, but it does require a modern browser
to handle it. Some mobile browsers also support this.

resize ​
<instance> resize(width, height) ​
Description:
Call this to modify the size of the Phaser canvas element directly.
You should only use this if you are using the NONE scale mode,
it will update all internal components completely.
If all you want to do is change the size of the parent, see the setParentSize method.
If all you want is to change the base size of the game, but still have the Scale Manager
manage all the scaling (i.e. you're not using NONE ), then see the setGameSize method.
This method will set the gameSize , baseSize and displaySize components to the given
dimensions. It will then resize the canvas width and height to the values given, by
directly setting the properties. Finally, if you have set the Scale Manager zoom value
to anything other than 1 (the default), it will set the canvas CSS width and height to
be the given size multiplied by the zoom factor (the canvas pixel size remains untouched).
If you have enabled autoCenter , it is then passed to the updateCenter method and
the margins are set, allowing the canvas to be centered based on its parent element
alone. Finally, the displayScale is adjusted and the RESIZE event dispatched.
Parameters:
name type optional description
width number No The new width of the game.
height number No The new height of the game.
Returns: Phaser.Scale.ScaleManager - The Scale Manager instance.
Fires: Phaser.Scale.Events#event:RESIZE
Source: src/scale/ScaleManager.js#L802
Since: 3.16.0
setGameSize ​
<instance> setGameSize(width, height) ​
Description:
This method will set a new size for your game.
It should only be used if you're looking to change the base size of your game and are using
one of the Scale Manager scaling modes, i.e. FIT . If you're using NONE and wish to
change the game and canvas size directly, then please use the resize method instead.
Parameters:
name type optional description
width number No The new width of the game.
height number No The new height of the game.
Returns: Phaser.Scale.ScaleManager - The Scale Manager instance.
Fires: Phaser.Scale.Events#event:RESIZE
Source: src/scale/ScaleManager.js#L751
Since: 3.16.0
setMaxZoom ​
<instance> setMaxZoom() ​
Description:
Sets the zoom to be the maximum possible based on the current parent size.
Returns: Phaser.Scale.ScaleManager - The Scale Manager instance.
Fires: Phaser.Scale.Events#event:RESIZE
Source: src/scale/ScaleManager.js#L903
Since: 3.16.0
setParentSize ​
<instance> setParentSize(width, height) ​
Description:
This method will set the size of the Parent Size component, which is used in scaling
and centering calculations. You only need to call this method if you have explicitly
disabled the use of a parent in your game config, but still wish to take advantage of
other Scale Manager features.
Parameters:
name type optional description
width number No The new width of the parent.
height number No The new height of the parent.
Returns: Phaser.Scale.ScaleManager - The Scale Manager instance.
Fires: Phaser.Scale.Events#event:RESIZE
Source: src/scale/ScaleManager.js#L729
Since: 3.16.0
setSnap ​
<instance> setSnap([snapWidth], [snapHeight]) ​
Description:
By setting a Snap value, when the browser size is modified, its dimensions will automatically
be snapped to the nearest grid slice, using floor. For example, if you have snap value of 16,
and the width changes to 68, then it will snap down to 64 (the closest multiple of 16 when floored)
This mode is best used with the FIT scale mode.
Call this method with no arguments to reset the snap values.
Calling this method automatically invokes ScaleManager.refresh which emits a RESIZE event.
Parameters:
name type optional default description
snapWidth number Yes 0 The amount to snap the width to. If you don't want to snap the width, pass a value of zero.
snapHeight number Yes "snapWidth" The amount to snap the height to. If not provided it will use the snapWidth value. If you don't want to snap the height, pass a value of zero.
Returns: Phaser.Scale.ScaleManager - The Scale Manager instance.
Fires: Phaser.Scale.Events#event:RESIZE
Source: src/scale/ScaleManager.js#L920

Parameters:
name type optional description
value number No The new zoom value of the game.
Returns: Phaser.Scale.ScaleManager - The Scale Manager instance.
Fires: Phaser.Scale.Events#event:RESIZE
Source: src/scale/ScaleManager.js#L884
Since: 3.16.0
startFullscreen ​
<instance> startFullscreen([fullscreenOptions]) ​
Description:
Sends a request to the browser to ask it to go in to full screen mode, using the {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fullscreen_API Fullscreen API}.
If the browser does not support this, a FULLSCREEN_UNSUPPORTED event will be emitted.
This method must be called from a pointerup user-input gesture ( not pointerdown ). You cannot launch
games fullscreen without this, as most browsers block it. Games within an iframe will also be blocked
from fullscreen unless the iframe has the allowfullscreen attribute.
On touch devices, such as Android and iOS Safari, you should always use pointerup and NOT pointerdown ,
otherwise the request will fail unless the document in which your game is embedded has already received
some form of touch input, which you cannot guarantee. Activating fullscreen via pointerup circumvents
this issue.
Performing an action that navigates to another page, or opens another tab, will automatically cancel
fullscreen mode, as will the user pressing the ESC key. To cancel fullscreen mode directly from your game,
i.e. by clicking an icon, call the stopFullscreen method.
A browser can only send one DOM element into fullscreen. You can control which element this is by
setting the fullscreenTarget property in your game config, or changing the property in the Scale Manager.
Note that the game canvas must be a child of the target. If you do not give a target, Phaser will
automatically create a blank <div> element and move the canvas into it, before going fullscreen.
When it leaves fullscreen, the div will be removed.
Parameters:
name type optional description
fullscreenOptions object Yes The FullscreenOptions dictionary is used to provide configuration options when entering full screen.
Fires: Phaser.Scale.Events#event:ENTER_FULLSCREEN , Phaser.Scale.Events#event:FULLSCREEN_FAILED , Phaser.Scale.Events#event:FULLSCREEN_UNSUPPORTED , Phaser.Scale.Events#event:RESIZE

Source: src/scale/ScaleManager.js#L1520
Since: 3.16.0
step ​
<instance> step(time, delta) ​
Description:
Internal method, called automatically by the game step.
Monitors the elapsed time and resize interval to see if a parent bounds check needs to take place.
Parameters:
name type optional description
time number No The time value from the most recent Game step. Typically a high-resolution timer value, or Date.now().

updateCenter ​
<instance> updateCenter() ​
Description:
Calculates and updates the canvas CSS style in order to center it within the
bounds of its parent. If you have explicitly set parent to be null in your

setParentSize method first.
It works by modifying the canvas CSS marginLeft and marginTop properties.
If they have already been set by your own style sheet, or code, this will overwrite them.
To prevent the Scale Manager from centering the canvas, either do not set the
autoCenter property in your game config, or make sure it is set to NO_CENTER .
