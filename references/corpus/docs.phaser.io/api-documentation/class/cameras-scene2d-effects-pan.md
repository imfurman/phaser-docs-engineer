Pan
A Camera Pan effect.
This effect will scroll the Camera so that the center of its viewport finishes at the given destination,
over the duration and with the ease specified.
Only the camera scroll is moved. None of the objects it is displaying are impacted, i.e. their positions do
not change.
The effect will dispatch several events on the Camera itself and you can also specify an onUpdate callback,
which is invoked each frame for the duration of the effect if required.

<instance> start(x, y, [duration], [ease], [force], [callback], [context]) ​
Description:
This effect will scroll the Camera so that the center of its viewport finishes at the given destination,
over the duration and with the ease specified.
Parameters:
name type optional default description
x number No The destination x coordinate to scroll the center of the Camera viewport to.
y number No The destination y coordinate to scroll the center of the Camera viewport to.
duration number Yes 1000 The duration of the effect in milliseconds.
ease string | function Yes "'Linear'" The ease to use for the pan. Can be any of the Phaser Easing constants or a custom function.
force boolean Yes false Force the pan effect to start immediately, even if already running.
callback Phaser.Types.Cameras.Scene2D.CameraPanCallback Yes This callback will be invoked every frame for the duration of the effect. It is sent four arguments: A reference to the camera, a progress amount between 0 and 1 indicating how complete the effect is, the current camera scroll x coordinate and the current camera scroll y coordinate.
context any Yes The context in which the callback is invoked. Defaults to the Scene to which the Camera belongs.
Returns: Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D.Camera - The Camera on which the effect was started.
