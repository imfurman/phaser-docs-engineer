TimerEvent
A Timer Event represents a delayed function call. It's managed by a Scene's Clock and will call its function after a set amount of time has passed. The Timer Event can optionally repeat - i.e. call its function multiple times before finishing, or loop indefinitely.
Because it's managed by a Clock, a Timer Event is based on game time, will be affected by its Clock's time scale, and will pause if its Clock pauses.
Constructor
new TimerEvent(config)
Parameters
name type optional description
config Phaser.Types.Time.TimerEventConfig No The configuration for the Timer Event, including its delay and callback.
Scope : static

Public Members ​
args ​
args: array ​
Description:
Additional arguments to be passed to the callback.
Source: src/time/TimerEvent.js#L90
Since: 3.0.0
callback ​
callback: function ​
Description:
The callback that will be called when the TimerEvent occurs.
Source: src/time/TimerEvent.js#L72
Since: 3.0.0
callbackScope ​
callbackScope: object ​
Description:
The scope in which the callback will be called.
Source: src/time/TimerEvent.js#L81
Since: 3.0.0
delay ​
delay: number ​
Description:
The delay in ms at which this TimerEvent fires.
Source: src/time/TimerEvent.js#L29
Since: 3.0.0
elapsed ​
elapsed: number ​
Description:
The time in milliseconds which has elapsed since the Timer Event's creation.
This value is local for the Timer Event and is relative to its Clock. As such, it's influenced by the Clock's time scale and paused state, the Timer Event's initial #startAt property, and the Timer Event's #timeScale and #paused state.
Source: src/time/TimerEvent.js#L119
Since: 3.0.0
hasDispatched ​
hasDispatched: boolean ​
Description:
Whether the Timer Event's function has been called.
When the Timer Event fires, this property will be set to true before the callback function is invoked and will be reset immediately afterward if the Timer Event should repeat. The value of this property does not directly influence whether the Timer Event will be removed from its Clock, but can prevent it from firing.
Source: src/time/TimerEvent.js#L141
Since: 3.0.0
loop ​
loop: boolean ​
Description:
True if this TimerEvent loops, otherwise false.
Source: src/time/TimerEvent.js#L61
Since: 3.0.0
paused ​
paused: boolean ​
Description:
Whether or not this timer is paused.
Source: src/time/TimerEvent.js#L131
Since: 3.0.0
repeat ​
repeat: number ​
Description:
The total number of times this TimerEvent will repeat before finishing.
Source: src/time/TimerEvent.js#L40
Since: 3.0.0
repeatCount ​
repeatCount: number ​
Description:
If repeating this contains the current repeat count.
Source: src/time/TimerEvent.js#L51
Since: 3.0.0
startAt ​
startAt: number ​
Description:
Start this many MS into the elapsed (useful if you want a long duration with repeat, but for the first loop to fire quickly)
Source: src/time/TimerEvent.js#L109
Since: 3.0.0
timeScale ​
timeScale: number ​
Description:
Scale the time causing this TimerEvent to update.
Source: src/time/TimerEvent.js#L99
Since: 3.0.0
Public Methods ​
destroy ​
<instance> destroy() ​
Description:
Destroys all object references in the Timer Event, i.e. its callback, scope, and arguments.
Normally, this method is only called by the Clock when it shuts down. As such, it doesn't stop the Timer Event. If called manually, the Timer Event will still be updated by the Clock, but it won't do anything when it fires.

Since: 3.0.0
getElapsed ​
<instance> getElapsed() ​
Description:
Returns the local elapsed time for the current iteration of the Timer Event.
Returns: number - The local elapsed time in milliseconds.
Source: src/time/TimerEvent.js#L250
Since: 3.0.0
getElapsedSeconds ​
<instance> getElapsedSeconds() ​
Description:
Returns the local elapsed time for the current iteration of the Timer Event in seconds.
Returns: number - The local elapsed time in seconds.
Source: src/time/TimerEvent.js#L263
Since: 3.0.0
getOverallProgress ​
<instance> getOverallProgress() ​
Description:
Gets the progress of the timer overall, factoring in repeats.
Returns: number - The overall progress of the Timer Event, between 0 and 1.
Source: src/time/TimerEvent.js#L212
Since: 3.0.0
getOverallRemaining ​
<instance> getOverallRemaining() ​
Description:
Returns the time interval until the last iteration of the Timer Event.
Returns: number - The time interval in milliseconds.
Source: src/time/TimerEvent.js#L302
Since: 3.50.0
getOverallRemainingSeconds ​
<instance> getOverallRemainingSeconds() ​
Description:
Returns the time interval until the last iteration of the Timer Event in seconds.
Returns: number - The time interval in seconds.
Source: src/time/TimerEvent.js#L315
Since: 3.50.0
getProgress ​
<instance> getProgress() ​
Description:
Gets the progress of the current iteration, not factoring in repeats.
Returns: number - A number between 0 and 1 representing the current progress.
Source: src/time/TimerEvent.js#L199
Since: 3.0.0
getRemaining ​
<instance> getRemaining() ​
Description:
Returns the time interval until the next iteration of the Timer Event.
Returns: number - The time interval in milliseconds.
Source: src/time/TimerEvent.js#L276
Since: 3.50.0
getRemainingSeconds ​
<instance> getRemainingSeconds() ​
Description:
Returns the time interval until the next iteration of the Timer Event in seconds.
Returns: number - The time interval in seconds.
Source: src/time/TimerEvent.js#L289
Since: 3.50.0
getRepeatCount ​
<instance> getRepeatCount() ​
Description:
Returns the number of times this Timer Event will repeat before finishing.
This should not be confused with the number of times the Timer Event will fire before finishing. A return value of 0 doesn't indicate that the Timer Event has finished running - it indicates that it will not repeat after the next time it fires.
Returns: number - How many times the Timer Event will repeat.
Source: src/time/TimerEvent.js#L235
Since: 3.0.0
remove ​
<instance> remove([dispatchCallback]) ​
Description:
Forces the Timer Event to immediately expire, thus scheduling its removal in the next frame.
Parameters:
name type optional default description
dispatchCallback boolean Yes false If true , the function of the Timer Event will be called before its removal.
Source: src/time/TimerEvent.js#L328
Since: 3.0.0
reset ​
<instance> reset(config) ​
Description:
Completely reinitializes the Timer Event, regardless of its current state, according to a configuration object.
Parameters:
name type optional description
config Phaser.Types.Time.TimerEventConfig No The new state for the Timer Event.
Returns: Phaser.Time.TimerEvent - This TimerEvent object.
