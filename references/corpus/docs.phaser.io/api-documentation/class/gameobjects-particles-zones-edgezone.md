EdgeZone
A zone that places particles on a shape's edges.
Constructor
new EdgeZone(source, quantity, [stepRate], [yoyo], [seamless], [total])
Parameters
name type optional default description
source Phaser.Types.GameObjects.Particles.EdgeZoneSource No An object instance with a getPoints(quantity, stepRate) method returning an array of points.
quantity number No The number of particles to place on the source edge. Set to 0 to use stepRate instead.
stepRate number Yes The distance between each particle. When set, quantity is implied and should be set to 0.
yoyo boolean Yes false Whether particles are placed from start to end and then end to start.
seamless boolean Yes true Whether one endpoint will be removed if it's identical to the other.
total number Yes -1 The total number of particles this zone will emit before passing over to the next emission zone in the Emitter. -1 means it will never pass over and you must use setEmitZone to change it.

counter ​
counter: number ​
Description:
The counter used for iterating the EdgeZone's points.

points: Array.< Phaser.Geom.Point > ​
Description:
The points placed on the source edge.

Description:
The number of particles to place on the source edge. Set to 0 to use stepRate instead.

Description:
An object instance with a getPoints(quantity, stepRate) method returning an array of points.

stepRate ​
stepRate: number ​
Description:
The distance between each particle. When set, quantity is implied and should be set to 0.
Source: src/gameobjects/particles/zones/EdgeZone.js#L63
Since: 3.0.0
total ​
total: number ​
Description:
The total number of particles this zone will emit before the Emitter
transfers control over to the next zone in its emission zone list.
By default this is -1, meaning it will never pass over from this
zone to another one. You can call the ParticleEmitter.setEmitZone
method to change it, or set this value to something else via the
config, or directly at runtime.
A value of 1 would mean the zones rotate in order, but it can
be set to any integer value.

yoyo: boolean ​
Description:
