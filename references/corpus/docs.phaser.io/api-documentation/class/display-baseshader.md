BaseShader
A BaseShader is a small resource class that contains the data required for a WebGL Shader to be created.
It contains the raw source code to the fragment and vertex shader, as well as an object that defines
the uniforms the shader requires, if any.
BaseShaders are stored in the Shader Cache, available in a Scene via this.cache.shaders and are referenced
by a unique key-based string. Retrieve them via this.cache.shaders.get(key) .
BaseShaders are created automatically by the GLSL File Loader when loading an external shader resource.
They can also be created at runtime, allowing you to use dynamically generated shader source code.
Default fragment and vertex source is used if not provided in the constructor, setting-up a basic shader,
suitable for debug rendering.
Constructor
new BaseShader(key, [fragmentSrc], [vertexSrc], [uniforms])
Parameters
name type optional description
key string No The key of this shader. Must be unique within the shader cache.
fragmentSrc string Yes The fragment source for the shader.
vertexSrc string Yes The vertex source for the shader.
uniforms any Yes Optional object defining the uniforms the shader uses.
