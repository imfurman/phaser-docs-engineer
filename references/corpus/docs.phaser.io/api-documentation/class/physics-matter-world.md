World
The Matter World class is responsible for managing one single instance of a Matter Physics World for Phaser.
Access this via this.matter.world from within a Scene.
This class creates a Matter JS World Composite along with the Matter JS Engine during instantiation. It also
handles delta timing, bounds, body and constraint creation and debug drawing.
If you wish to access the Matter JS World object directly, see the localWorld property.
If you wish to access the Matter Engine directly, see the engine property.
This class is an Event Emitter and will proxy all Matter JS events, as they are received.
Constructor
new World(scene, config)
Parameters
name type optional description
scene Phaser.Scene No The Scene to which this Matter World instance belongs.
config Phaser.Types.Physics.Matter.MatterWorldConfig No The Matter World configuration object.

autoUpdate ​
autoUpdate: boolean ​
Description:
Automatically call Engine.update every time the game steps.
If you disable this then you are responsible for calling World.step directly from your game.
If you call set60Hz or set30Hz then autoUpdate is reset to true .

Since: 3.4.0
debugConfig ​
debugConfig: Phaser.Types.Physics.Matter.MatterDebugConfig ​
Description:
The debug configuration object.
The values stored in this object are read from the Matter World Config debug property.
When a new Body or Constraint is added to the World , they are given the values stored in this object,
unless they have their own render object set that will override them.
Note that while you can modify the values of properties in this object at run-time, it will not change
any of the Matter objects already added . It will only impact objects newly added to the world, or one
that is removed and then re-added at a later time.

getDelta ​
getDelta: function ​
Description:
This function is called every time the core game loop steps, which is bound to the
Request Animation Frame frequency unless otherwise modified.
The function is passed two values: time and delta , both of which come from the game step values.
It must return a number. This number is used as the delta value passed to Matter.Engine.update.
You can override this function with your own to define your own timestep.
If you need to update the Engine multiple times in a single game step then call
World.update as many times as required. Each call will trigger the getDelta function.
If you wish to have full control over when the Engine updates then see the property autoUpdate .
You can also adjust the number of iterations that Engine.update performs.
Use the Scene Matter Physics config object to set the following properties:
positionIterations (defaults to 6)
velocityIterations (defaults to 4)
constraintIterations (defaults to 2)
Adjusting these values can help performance in certain situations, depending on the physics requirements
of your game.

step ​
<instance> step([delta]) ​
Description:
Manually advances the physics simulation by one iteration.
You can optionally pass in the delta and correction values to be used by Engine.update.
If undefined they use the Matter defaults of 60Hz and no correction.
Calling step directly bypasses any checks of enabled or autoUpdate .
It also ignores any custom getDelta functions, as you should be passing the delta
value in to this call.
You can adjust the number of iterations that Engine.update performs internally.
Use the Scene Matter Physics config object to set the following properties:
positionIterations (defaults to 6)
velocityIterations (defaults to 4)
constraintIterations (defaults to 2)
Adjusting these values can help performance in certain situations, depending on the physics requirements
of your game.
Parameters:
name type optional default description
delta number Yes 16.666 The delta value.
Source: src/physics/matter-js/World.js#L1268
Since: 3.4.0
update ​
<instance> update(time, delta) ​
Description:
The internal update method. This is called automatically by the parent Scene.
Moves the simulation forward in time by delta ms. Uses World.correction value as an optional number that
specifies the time correction factor to apply to the update. This can help improve the accuracy of the
simulation in cases where delta is changing between updates. The value of correction is defined as delta / lastDelta ,
i.e. the percentage change of delta over the last step. Therefore the value is always 1 (no correction) when
delta is constant (or when no correction is desired, which is the default).
See the paper on Time Corrected Verlet for more information.
Triggers beforeUpdate and afterUpdate events. Triggers collisionStart , collisionActive and collisionEnd events.
If the World is paused, update is still run, but exits early and does not update the Matter Engine.
Parameters:
name type optional description
time number No The current time. Either a High Resolution Timer value if it comes from Request Animation Frame, or Date.now if using SetTimeout.
delta number No The delta time in ms since the last frame. This is a smoothed and capped value based on the FPS rate.
