Texture
A Texture consists of a source, usually an Image from the Cache, and a collection of Frames.
The Frames represent the different areas of the Texture. For example a texture atlas
may have many Frames, one for each element within the atlas. Where-as a single image would have
just one frame, that encompasses the whole image.
Every Texture, no matter where it comes from, always has at least 1 frame called the __BASE frame.
This frame represents the entirety of the source image.
Textures are managed by the global TextureManager. This is a singleton class that is
responsible for creating and delivering Textures and their corresponding Frames to Game Objects.
Sprites and other Game Objects get the texture data they need from the TextureManager.
Constructor
new Texture(manager, key, source, [width], [height])

Public Methods ​
add ​
<instance> add(name, sourceIndex, x, y, width, height) ​
Description:
Adds a new Frame to this Texture.
A Frame is a rectangular region of a TextureSource with a unique index or string-based key.
The name given must be unique within this Texture. If it already exists, this method will return null .
Parameters:
name type optional description
name number | string No The name of this Frame. The name is unique within the Texture.
sourceIndex number No The index of the TextureSource that this Frame is a part of.
x number No The x coordinate of the top-left of this Frame.
y number No The y coordinate of the top-left of this Frame.
width number No The width of this Frame.
height number No The height of this Frame.
Returns: Phaser.Textures.Frame - The Frame that was added to this Texture, or null if the given name already exists.

Since: 3.0.0
destroy ​
<instance> destroy() ​
Description:
Destroys this Texture and releases references to its sources and frames.
Source: src/textures/Texture.js#L531
Since: 3.0.0
get ​
<instance> get([name]) ​
Description:
Gets a Frame from this Texture based on either the key or the index of the Frame.
In a Texture Atlas Frames are typically referenced by a key.
In a Sprite Sheet Frames are referenced by an index.
Passing no value for the name returns the base texture.
Parameters:
name type optional description
name string | number Yes The string-based name, or integer based index, of the Frame to get from this Texture.
Returns: Phaser.Textures.Frame - The Texture Frame.
Source: src/textures/Texture.js#L224
Since: 3.0.0
getDataSourceImage ​
<instance> getDataSourceImage([name]) ​
Description:
Given a Frame name, return the data source image it uses to render with.
You can use this to get the normal map for an image for example.
This will return the actual DOM Image.
Parameters:
name type optional description
name string | number Yes The string-based name, or integer based index, of the Frame to get from this Texture.
Returns: HTMLImageElement, HTMLCanvasElement - The DOM Image or Canvas Element.
Source: src/textures/Texture.js#L439
Since: 3.7.0
getFrameBounds ​
<instance> getFrameBounds([sourceIndex]) ​
Description:
Based on the given Texture Source Index, this method will get all of the Frames using
that source and then work out the bounds that they encompass, returning them in an object.
This is useful if this Texture is, for example, a sprite sheet within an Atlas, and you
need to know the total bounds of the sprite sheet.
Parameters:
name type optional default description
sourceIndex number Yes 0 The index of the TextureSource to get the Frame bounds from.
Returns: Phaser.Types.Math.RectangleLike - An object containing the bounds of the Frames using the given Texture Source Index.
Source: src/textures/Texture.js#L319
Since: 3.80.0
getFrameNames ​
<instance> getFrameNames([includeBase]) ​
Description:
Returns an array with all of the names of the Frames in this Texture.
Useful if you want to randomly assign a Frame to a Game Object, as you can
pick a random element from the returned array.
Parameters:
name type optional default description
includeBase boolean Yes false Include the __BASE Frame in the output array?
Returns: Array.<string> - An array of all Frame names in this Texture.
Source: src/textures/Texture.js#L374

Returns: HTMLImageElement, HTMLCanvasElement, Phaser.GameObjects.RenderTexture - The DOM Image, Canvas Element or Render Texture.
Source: src/textures/Texture.js#L406
Since: 3.0.0
getTextureSourceIndex ​
<instance> getTextureSourceIndex(source) ​
Description:
Takes the given TextureSource and returns the index of it within this Texture.
If it's not in this Texture, it returns -1.
Unless this Texture has multiple TextureSources, such as with a multi-atlas, this
method will always return zero or -1.
Parameters:
name type optional description
source Phaser.Textures.TextureSource No The TextureSource to check.
Returns: number - The index of the TextureSource within this Texture, or -1 if not in this Texture.

remove ​
<instance> remove(name) ​
Description:
Removes the given Frame from this Texture. The Frame is destroyed immediately.
Any Game Objects using this Frame should stop using it before you remove it,
as it does not happen automatically.
Parameters:
name type optional description
name string No The key of the Frame to remove.
Returns: boolean - True if a Frame with the matching key was removed from this Texture.
