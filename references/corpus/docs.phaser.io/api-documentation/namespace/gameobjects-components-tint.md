Since: 3.11.0
tintTopLeft ​
tintTopLeft: number ​
Description:
The tint value being applied to the top-left vertice of the Game Object.

Static functions ​

Returns: Phaser.GameObjects.Components.Tint - This Game Object instance.
Source: src/gameobjects/components/Tint.js#L79
Since: 3.0.0
setTint ​
<instance> setTint([topLeft], [topRight], [bottomLeft], [bottomRight]) ​
Description:
Sets an additive tint on this Game Object.
The tint works by taking the pixel color values from the Game Objects texture, and then
multiplying it by the color value of the tint. You can provide either one color value,
in which case the whole Game Object will be tinted in that color. Or you can provide a color
per corner. The colors are blended together across the extent of the Game Object.
To modify the tint color once set, either call this method again with new values or use the
tint property to set all colors at once. Or, use the properties tintTopLeft , `tintTopRight,
tintBottomLeft and tintBottomRight to set the corner color values independently.
To remove a tint call clearTint .
To swap this from being an additive tint to a fill based tint set the property tintFill to true .

Parameters:
name type optional default description
topLeft number Yes "0xffffff" The tint being applied to the top-left of the Game Object. If no other values are given this value is applied evenly, tinting the whole Game Object.
topRight number Yes The tint being applied to the top-right of the Game Object.
bottomLeft number Yes The tint being applied to the bottom-left of the Game Object.
bottomRight number Yes The tint being applied to the bottom-right of the Game Object.
Returns: Phaser.GameObjects.Components.Tint - This Game Object instance.

Since: 3.0.0
setTintFill ​
<instance> setTintFill([topLeft], [topRight], [bottomLeft], [bottomRight]) ​
Description:
Sets a fill-based tint on this Game Object.
Unlike an additive tint, a fill-tint literally replaces the pixel colors from the texture
with those in the tint. You can use this for effects such as making a player flash 'white'
if hit by something. You can provide either one color value, in which case the whole
Game Object will be rendered in that color. Or you can provide a color per corner. The colors
are blended together across the extent of the Game Object.
To modify the tint color once set, either call this method again with new values or use the
tint property to set all colors at once. Or, use the properties tintTopLeft , `tintTopRight,
tintBottomLeft and tintBottomRight to set the corner color values independently.
To remove a tint call clearTint .
To swap this from being a fill-tint to an additive tint set the property tintFill to false .
