postFX ​
postFX: Phaser.GameObjects.Components.FX ​
Description:
The Post FX component of this Game Object.
This component allows you to apply a variety of built-in effects to this Game Object, such
as glow, blur, bloom, displacements, vignettes and more. You access them via this property,
for example:
const player = this . add . sprite ( ) ;
player . postFX . addBloom ( ) ;
All FX are WebGL only and do not have Canvas counterparts.
Please see the FX Class for more details and available methods.
This property is always null until the initPostPipeline method is called.

postPipelines ​
postPipelines: Array.< Phaser.Renderer.WebGL.Pipelines.PostFXPipeline > ​
Description:
The WebGL Post FX Pipelines this Game Object uses for post-render effects.
The pipelines are processed in the order in which they appear in this array.
If you modify this array directly, be sure to set the
hasPostPipeline property accordingly.

preFX ​
preFX: Phaser.GameObjects.Components.FX ​
Description:
The Pre FX component of this Game Object.
This component allows you to apply a variety of built-in effects to this Game Object, such
as glow, blur, bloom, displacements, vignettes and more. You access them via this property,
for example:
const player = this . add . sprite ( ) ;
player . preFX . addBloom ( ) ;
Only the following Game Objects support Pre FX:
Image
Sprite
TileSprite
Text
RenderTexture
Video
All FX are WebGL only and do not have Canvas counterparts.
Please see the FX Class for more details and available methods.

Static functions ​
clearFX ​
<instance> clearFX() ​
Description:
Removes all Pre and Post FX Controllers from this Game Object.
If you wish to remove a single controller, use the preFX.remove(fx) or postFX.remove(fx) methods instead.
If you wish to clear a single controller, use the preFX.clear() or postFX.clear() methods instead.

Returns: Phaser.GameObjects.Components.PostPipeline - This Game Object.
Source: src/gameobjects/components/PostPipeline.js#L337
Since: 3.60.0
getPostPipeline ​
<instance> getPostPipeline(pipeline) ​
Description:
Gets a Post Pipeline instance from this Game Object, based on the given name, and returns it.
Tags:
webglOnly
Parameters:
name type optional description
pipeline string | function Phaser.Renderer.WebGL.Pipelines.PostFXPipeline No
Returns: Phaser.Renderer.WebGL.Pipelines.PostFXPipeline , Array.< Phaser.Renderer.WebGL.Pipelines.PostFXPipeline > - An array of all the Post Pipelines matching the name. This array will be empty if there was no match. If there was only one single match, that pipeline is returned directly, not in an array.
Source: src/gameobjects/components/PostPipeline.js#L237
Since: 3.60.0
initPostPipeline ​
<instance> initPostPipeline([preFX]) ​
Description:
This should only be called during the instantiation of the Game Object.
It is called by default by all core Game Objects and doesn't need
calling again.
After that, use setPostPipeline .
Tags:

Parameters:
name type optional default description
preFX boolean Yes false Does this Game Object support Pre FX?
Source: src/gameobjects/components/PostPipeline.js#L113
Since: 3.60.0
removePostPipeline ​
<instance> removePostPipeline(pipeline) ​
Description:
Removes a type of Post Pipeline instances from this Game Object, based on the given name, and destroys them.
If you wish to remove all Post Pipelines use the resetPostPipeline method instead.
Tags:
webglOnly
Parameters:
name type optional description
pipeline string | Phaser.Renderer.WebGL.Pipelines.PostFXPipeline No The string-based name of the pipeline, or a pipeline class.
Returns: Phaser.GameObjects.Components.PostPipeline - This Game Object.
Source: src/gameobjects/components/PostPipeline.js#L299
Since: 3.60.0
resetPostPipeline ​
<instance> resetPostPipeline([resetData]) ​
Description:
Resets the WebGL Post Pipelines of this Game Object. It does this by calling
the destroy method on each post pipeline and then clearing the local array.
Tags:
webglOnly
Parameters:
name type optional default description
resetData boolean Yes false Reset the postPipelineData object to being an empty object?
Source: src/gameobjects/components/PostPipeline.js#L269
Since: 3.60.0
setPostPipeline ​
<instance> setPostPipeline(pipelines, [pipelineData], [copyData]) ​
Description:
Sets one, or more, Post Pipelines on this Game Object.
Post Pipelines are invoked after this Game Object has rendered to its target and
are commonly used for post-fx.
The post pipelines are appended to the postPipelines array belonging to this
Game Object. When the renderer processes this Game Object, it iterates through the post
pipelines in the order in which they appear in the array. If you are stacking together
multiple effects, be aware that the order is important.
If you call this method multiple times, the new pipelines will be appended to any existing
post pipelines already set. Use the resetPostPipeline method to clear them first, if required.
You can optionally also set the postPipelineData property, if the parameter is given.

Parameters:
name type optional default description
pipelines string | Array.<string> function Array.<function()> Phaser.Renderer.WebGL.Pipelines.PostFXPipeline
pipelineData object Yes Optional pipeline data object that is set in to the postPipelineData property of this Game Object.
copyData boolean Yes true Should the pipeline data object be deep copied into the postPipelineData property of this Game Object? If false it will be set by reference instead.
Returns: Phaser.GameObjects.Components.PostPipeline - This Game Object instance.
Source: src/gameobjects/components/PostPipeline.js#L140
Since: 3.60.0
setPostPipelineData ​
<instance> setPostPipelineData(key, [value]) ​
Description:
Adds an entry to the postPipelineData object belonging to this Game Object.
If the 'key' already exists, its value is updated. If it doesn't exist, it is created.
If value is undefined, and key exists, key is removed from the data object.
Tags:

Parameters:
name type optional description
key string No The key of the pipeline data to set, update, or delete.
value any Yes The value to be set with the key. If undefined then key will be deleted from the object.
Returns: Phaser.GameObjects.Components.PostPipeline - This Game Object instance.
