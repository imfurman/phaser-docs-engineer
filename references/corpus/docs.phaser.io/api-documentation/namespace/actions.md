ShiftPosition ​
<static> ShiftPosition(items, x, y, [direction], [output]) ​
Description:
Takes an array of items, such as Game Objects, or any objects with public x and
y properties and then iterates through them. As this function iterates, it moves
the position of the current element to be that of the previous entry in the array.
This repeats until all items have been moved.
The direction controls the order of iteration. A value of 0 (the default) assumes
that the final item in the array is the 'head' item.
A direction value of 1 assumes that the first item in the array is the 'head' item.
The position of the 'head' item is set to the x/y values given to this function.
Every other item in the array is then updated, in sequence, to be that of the
previous (or next) entry in the array.
The final x/y coords are returned, or set in the 'output' Vector2.
Think of it as being like the game Snake, where the 'head' is moved and then
each body piece is moved into the space of the previous piece.

SmootherStep ​
<static> SmootherStep(items, property, min, max, [inc]) ​
Description:
Smootherstep is a sigmoid-like interpolation and clamping function.
The function depends on three parameters, the input x, the "left edge" and the "right edge", with the left edge being assumed smaller than the right edge. The function receives a real number x as an argument and returns 0 if x is less than or equal to the left edge, 1 if x is greater than or equal to the right edge, and smoothly interpolates, using a Hermite polynomial, between 0 and 1 otherwise. The slope of the smoothstep function is zero at both edges. This is convenient for creating a sequence of transitions using smoothstep to interpolate each segment as an alternative to using more sophisticated or expensive interpolation techniques.
