Scope: static

Static functions ​
LOSE_WEBGL ​
LOSE_WEBGL ​
Description:
The Lose WebGL Event.
This event is dispatched by the WebGLRenderer when the WebGL context
is lost.
Context can be lost for a variety of reasons, like leaving the browser tab.
The game canvas DOM object will dispatch webglcontextlost .
All WebGL resources get wiped, and the context is reset.
While WebGL is lost, the game will continue to run, but all WebGL resources
are lost, and new ones cannot be created.
Once the context is restored and the renderer has automatically restored
the state, the renderer will emit a RESTORE_WEBGL event. At that point,
it is safe to continue.
Parameters:
name type optional description
renderer Phaser.Renderer.WebGL.WebGLRenderer No the renderer that owns the WebGL context
Source: src/renderer/events/LOSE_WEBGL_EVENT.js#L7
Since: 3.80.0
POST_RENDER ​
POST_RENDER ​
Description:
The Post-Render Event.
This event is dispatched by the Renderer when all rendering, for all cameras in all Scenes,
has completed, but before any pending snap shots have been taken.
Source: src/renderer/events/POST_RENDER_EVENT.js#L7
Since: 3.50.0
PRE_RENDER ​
PRE_RENDER ​
Description:
The Pre-Render Event.
This event is dispatched by the Phaser Renderer. This happens right at the start of the render
process, after the context has been cleared, the scissors enabled (WebGL only) and everything has been
reset ready for the render.
Source: src/renderer/events/PRE_RENDER_EVENT.js#L7
Since: 3.50.0
PRE_RENDER_CLEAR ​
PRE_RENDER_CLEAR ​
Description:
The Pre-Render Clear Event.
This event is dispatched by the Phaser Renderer. It happens at the start of the render step, before
the WebGL gl.clear function has been called. This allows you to toggle the config.clearBeforeRender property
as required, to have fine-grained control over when the canvas is cleared during rendering.
Listen to it from within a Scene using: this.renderer.events.on('prerenderclear', listener) .
It's very important to understand that this event is called before the scissor and mask stacks are cleared.
This means you should not use this event to modify the scissor or mask. Instead, use the prerender event for that.
If using the Canvas Renderer, this event is dispatched before the canvas is cleared, but after the context globalAlpha
and transform have been reset.

Since: 3.85.0
RENDER ​
RENDER ​
Description:
The Render Event.
This event is dispatched by the Phaser Renderer for every camera in every Scene.
It is dispatched before any of the children in the Scene have been rendered.
Parameters:
name type optional description
scene Phaser.Scene No The Scene being rendered.
camera Phaser.Cameras.Scene2D.Camera No The Scene Camera being rendered.
Source: src/renderer/events/RENDER_EVENT.js#L7
Since: 3.50.0
RESIZE ​
RESIZE ​
Description:
The Renderer Resize Event.
This event is dispatched by the Phaser Renderer when it is resized, usually as a result
of the Scale Manager resizing.
Parameters:
name type optional description
width number No The new width of the renderer.
height number No The new height of the renderer.
Source: src/renderer/events/RESIZE_EVENT.js#L7
Since: 3.50.0
RESTORE_WEBGL ​
RESTORE_WEBGL ​
Description:
The Restore WebGL Event.
This event is dispatched by the WebGLRenderer when the WebGL context
is restored.
It is dispatched after all WebGL resources have been recreated.
Most resources should come back automatically, but you will need to redraw
dynamic textures that were GPU bound.
Listen to this event to know when you can safely do that.
Context can be lost for a variety of reasons, like leaving the browser tab.
The game canvas DOM object will dispatch webglcontextlost .
All WebGL resources get wiped, and the context is reset.
Once the context is restored, the canvas will dispatch
webglcontextrestored . Phaser uses this to re-create necessary resources.
Please wait for Phaser to dispatch the RESTORE_WEBGL event before
re-creating any resources of your own.
Parameters:
name type optional description
renderer Phaser.Renderer.WebGL.WebGLRenderer No the renderer that owns the WebGL context
