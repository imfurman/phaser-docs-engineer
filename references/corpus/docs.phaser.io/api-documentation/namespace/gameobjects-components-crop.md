frame ​
frame: Phaser.Textures.Frame ​
Description:
The Texture Frame this Game Object is using to render with.

isCropped ​
isCropped: boolean ​
Description:
A boolean flag indicating if this Game Object is being cropped or not.
You can toggle this at any time after setCrop has been called, to turn cropping on or off.
Equally, calling setCrop with no arguments will reset the crop and disable it.

Description:
The Texture this Game Object is using to render with.

setCrop ​
<instance> setCrop([x], [y], [width], [height]) ​
Description:
Applies a crop to a texture based Game Object, such as a Sprite or Image.
The crop is a rectangle that limits the area of the texture frame that is visible during rendering.
Cropping a Game Object does not change its size, dimensions, physics body or hit area, it just
changes what is shown when rendered.
The crop size as well as coordinates can not exceed the the size of the texture frame.
The crop coordinates are relative to the texture frame, not the Game Object, meaning 0 x 0 is the top-left.
Therefore, if you had a Game Object that had an 800x600 sized texture, and you wanted to show only the left
half of it, you could call setCrop(0, 0, 400, 600) .
It is also scaled to match the Game Object scale automatically. Therefore a crop rectangle of 100x50 would crop
an area of 200x100 when applied to a Game Object that had a scale factor of 2.
You can either pass in numeric values directly, or you can provide a single Rectangle object as the first argument.
Call this method with no arguments at all to reset the crop, or toggle the property isCropped to false .
You should do this if the crop rectangle becomes the same size as the frame itself, as it will allow
the renderer to skip several internal calculations.
Parameters:
name type optional description
x number | Phaser.Geom.Rectangle Yes The x coordinate to start the crop from. Cannot be negative or exceed the Frame width. Or a Phaser.Geom.Rectangle object, in which case the rest of the arguments are ignored.
y number Yes The y coordinate to start the crop from. Cannot be negative or exceed the Frame height.
width number Yes The width of the crop rectangle in pixels. Cannot exceed the Frame width.
height number Yes The height of the crop rectangle in pixels. Cannot exceed the Frame height.
Returns: Phaser.GameObjects.Components.Crop - This Game Object instance.
