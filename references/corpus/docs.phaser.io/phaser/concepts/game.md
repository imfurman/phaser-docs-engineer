Game
If you look at any Phaser example you'll see they all create an instance of the Phaser.Game class. Indeed, without it, nothing will actually happen. This one class can be considered as the heart of your game, for without it, nothing will run.
Typically, you only ever have one instance of a Phaser game at any given time. The Game class itself doesn't do a great deal, and beyond creating it, you rarely ever interact with it. Yet it's responsible for creating and updating all of the internal systems that your game needs while it is executing.
Even if you're creating the type of game that consists of lots of smaller games (think Mario Party, or Wario Ware), you'll still only ever have one instance of the Phaser Game class itself.
Creating a basic Phaser Game instance ​
new Phaser . Game ( {
scene : {
create : function ( ) {
this . add . text ( 0 , 0 , 'Hello world' ) ;
}
}
} ) ;
It's not necessary to wait for DOMContentLoaded or window.onload before creating the game.
But if you have external stylesheets or images that affect page layout and you're using the Scale Manager, you may need to use window.onload .
The game is available on all scenes as this.game and is passed as an argument to relevant callbacks and event listeners, so you usually don't need to save a reference to the game unless you need to reach it from outside Phaser.
Game configuration ​
Basic game configuration object:
const config = {
type : Phaser . AUTO , // automatically detect browser WebGL support
width : 800 , // canvas width
height : 600 , // canvas height
backgroundColor : '#2d2d2d' , // canvas background color
parent : 'phaser-example' , // parent DOM element
scene : Example //
} ;
Game config examples
You can read about the full list of config options here . For historical reasons, some config values can be set in two places: e.g., width and height are the same as scale.width and scale.height .
For most cases, you should add scenes and any plugins directly to the game config, as that's the simplest method.
Any special startup work should usually be done in the preBoot or postBoot callbacks.
preBoot runs only after DOMContentLoaded . game.config and game.device are available. Some game.config values can still be modified here. Most game systems have not been set up yet. You can add scenes to the game here. The game's BOOT event happens around the same time.
postBoot runs after all the game systems are ready. The game's READY event happens around the same time. Any scenes added before this are available (not pending) and have started if set to do so.
The game loop starts immediately after postBoot .
const config = {
preBoot : function ( game ) {
// Config (including defaults) has been created.
console . log ( 'game config' game . config ) ;
} ,
postBoot : function ( game ) {
// Game canvas has been created.
console . log ( 'game canvas' , game . canvas ) ;
}
} ;
const game = new Phaser . Game ( config ) ;
Global members ​
Scene manager ​
Global scene manager in game.scene , or scene.scene in each scene.
Data manager ​
Instance of data manager in game.registry , or scene.registry in each scene.
Get the data manager:
var value = scene . registry . get ( key ) ;
// var value = game.registry.get(key);
Add / update data in the data manager:
scene . registry . set ( key , value ) ;
// game.registry.set(key, value);
Events
Set data events:
scene . registry . events . on ( 'setdata' , function ( parent , key , value ) { /* ... */ } ) ;
// game.registry.events.on('setdata', function(parent, key, value){ /* ... */ })
Change data events:
scene . registry . events . on ( 'changedata' , function ( parent , key , value , previousValue ) { /* ... */ } ) ;
// game.registry.events.on('changedata', function(parent, key, value, previousValue){ /* ... */ })
scene . registry . events . on ( 'changedata-' + key , function ( parent , value , previousValue ) { /* ... */ } ) ;
// game.registry.events.on('changedata-' + key, function(parent, value, previousValue){ /* ... */ });
Game time ​
The time that the current game step started at.
var time = game . getTime ( ) ;
// var time = scene.game.getTime();
The current game frame.
var frameCount = game . getFrame ( ) ;
// var frameCount = scene.game.getFrame();
The delta time, since the last game step. This is a clamped and smoothed average value.
var delta = game . loop . delta ;
// var delta = scene.game.loop.delta;
Game config ​
var config = game . config ;
// var config = scene.game.config;
Window size ​
Window width:
var width = game . config . width ;
// var width = scene.game.config.width;
Window height:
var height = game . config . height ;
// var height = scene.game.config.height;
Pause and resume ​
You can pause or resume the entire game with its pause() and resume() methods. You won't be able to resume the game from Phaser's input events, though, since they're also paused.
Pause the entire game and emit a PAUSE event.
game . pause ( ) ;
Resume the entire game and emit a RESUME event.
game . resume ( ) ;
Is paused
var isPaused = game . isPaused ;
Events ​
Game events are emitted from the game's events .
FOCUS and BLUR happen when the game window or frame gains or loses focus by the user's mouse clicks or key presses.
HIDDEN and VISIBLE happen when the game tab or window is hidden, switched away from, minimized, or restored, per the Page Visibility API . Operating systems can differ here. PAUSE and RESUME events usually occur at the same time.
You can emit and listen to your own events on this emitter as long you avoid Phaser's event names.
Pause (window is invisible) / Resume (window is visible) events
game . events . on ( 'pause' , function ( ) { } ) ;
game . events . on ( 'resume' , function ( ) { } ) ;
Destroy event, triggered by game.destroy()
game . events . on ( 'destroy' , function ( ) { } )
On window focused/blurred events
game . events . on ( 'focus' , function ( ) { } )
game . events . on ( 'blur' , function ( ) { } )
Registry ​
The registry is the game's data store .
There's no way to pass registry data directly through the game config, but you can do it in a callback:
const config = {
callbacks : {
preBoot : function ( game ) {
game . registry . merge ( {
highScore : 0
} ) ;
}
}
} ;
const game = new Phaser . Game ( config ) ;
