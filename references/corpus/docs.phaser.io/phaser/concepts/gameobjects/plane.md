Plane
The Plane Game Object is a helper class that takes the Mesh Game Object and extends it, allowing for fast and easy creation of Planes. A Plane is a one-sided grid of cells, where you specify the number of cells in each dimension. The Plane can have a texture that is either repeated (tiled) across each cell, or applied to the full Plane.
The Plane can then be manipulated in 3D space, with rotation across all 3 axis.
This allows you to create effects not possible with regular Sprites, such as perspective distortion. You can also adjust the vertices on a per-vertex basis. Plane data becomes part of the WebGL batch, just like standard Sprites, so doesn't introduce any additional shader overhead. Because the Plane just generates vertices into the WebGL batch, like any other Sprite, you can use all of the common Game Object components on a Plane too, such as a custom pipeline, mask, blend mode or texture.
You can use the uvScroll and uvScale methods to adjust the placement and scaling of the texture if this Plane is using a single texture, and not a frame from a texture atlas or sprite sheet.
The Plane Game Object also has the Animation component, allowing you to play animations across the Plane just as you would with a Sprite. The animation frame size must be fixed as the first frame will be the size of the entire animation, for example use a SpriteSheet .
Note that the Plane object is WebGL only and does not have a Canvas counterpart.
The Plane origin is always 0.5 x 0.5 and cannot be changed .
Load texture ​
this . load . image ( key , url ) ;
Reference: load image
Add plane object ​
var plane = this . add . plane ( x , y , key ) ;
// var plane = this.add.plane(x, y, key, frame);
// var plane = this.add.plane(x, y, texture, frame, width, height, tile);
x , y : Position
key , frame : Texture key of
width , height : The width/height of this Plane, in cells , not pixels.
tile : Is the texture tiled? I.e. repeated across each cell.
Add plane from JSON
var plane = this . make . plane ( {
x : 0 ,
y : 0 ,
key : '' ,
// frame: '',
// width: 8,
// height: 8,
// tile: false,
// checkerboard: null,
// checkerboard: { color1, color2, alpha1, alpha2, height }
// angle: 0,
// alpha: 1,
// scale : {
// x: 1,
// y: 1
//},
// origin: {x: 0.5, y: 0.5},
add : true
} ) ;
Custom class ​
Define class
class MyPlane extends Phaser . GameObjects . Plane {
constructor ( scene , x , y , texture , frame , width , height , tile ) {
super ( scene , x , y , texture , frame , width , height , tile ) ;
// ...
this . add . existing ( this ) ;
}
// ...
// preUpdate(time, delta) {}
}
this.add.existing(gameObject) : Adds an existing Game Object to this Scene.
If the Game Object renders, it will be added to the Display List.
If it has a preUpdate method, it will be added to the Update List.
Create instance
var plane = new MyPlane ( scene , x , y , texture , frame , width , height , tile ) ;
Texture ​
See game object - texture
Animation ​
See Sprite's animation section .
Play animation ​
Play
plane . play ( key ) ;
// plane.play(key, ignoreIfPlaying);
key : Animation key string, or animation config
String key of animation
Animation config, to override default config
{
key ,
frameRate ,
duration ,
delay ,
repeat ,
repeatDelay ,
yoyo ,
showOnStart ,
hideOnComplete ,
startFrame ,
timeScale
}
Play in reverse
plane . playReverse ( key ) ;
// plane.playReverse(key, ignoreIfPlaying);
key : Animation key string, or animation config
Play after delay
plane . playAfterDelay ( key , delay ) ;
key : Animation key string, or animation config
Play after repeat
plane . playAfterRepeat ( key , repeatCount ) ;
key : Animation key string, or animation config
Stop ​
Immediately stop
plane . stop ( ) ;
Stop after delay
plane . stopAfterDelay ( delay ) ;
Stop at frame
plane . stopOnFrame ( frame ) ;
frame : Frame object in current animation.
var currentAnim = plane . anims . currentAnim ;
var frame = currentAnim . getFrameAt ( index ) ;
Stop after repeat
plane . stopAfterRepeat ( repeatCount ) ;
Properties ​
Has started
var hasStarted = plane . anims . hasStarted ;
Is playing
var isPlaying = plane . anims . isPlaying ;
Is paused
var isPaused = plane . anims . isPaused ;
Total frames count
var frameCount = plane . anims . getTotalFrames ( ) ;
Delay
var delay = plane . anims . delay ;
Repeat
Total repeat count
var repeatCount = plane . anims . repeat ;
Repeat counter
var repeatCount = plane . anims . repeatCounter ;
Repeat delay
var repeatDelay = plane . anims . repeatDelay ;
Yoyo
var repeatDelay = plane . anims . yoyo ;
Current animation key
var key = plane . anims . getName ( ) ;
key : Return '' if not playing any animation.
Current frame name
var frameName = plane . anims . getFrameName ( ) ;
frameName : Return '' if not playing any animation.
Current animation
var currentAnim = plane . anims . currentAnim ;
Current frame
var currentFrame = plane . anims . currentFrame ;
Interactive ​
To test if pointer is at any face of this mesh game object.
plane . setInteractive ( ) ;
Checkerboard ​
Creates a checkerboard style texture, based on the given colors and alpha values and applies it to this Plane, replacing any current texture it may have.
Create
plane . createCheckerboard ( color1 , color2 , alpha1 , alpha2 , height )
Remove
plane . removeCheckerboard ( ) ;
Other properties ​
See Mesh game object , game object
Create mask ​
var mask = plane . createBitmapMask ( ) ;
See mask
