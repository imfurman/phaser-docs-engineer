Video
This Game Object is capable of handling playback of a video file, video stream or media stream.
You can optionally 'preload' the video into the Phaser Video Cache:
preload ( ) {
this . load . video ( 'ripley' , 'assets/aliens.mp4' ) ;
}
create ( ) {
this . add . video ( 400 , 300 , 'ripley' ) ;
}
You don't have to 'preload' the video. You can also play it directly from a URL:
create ( ) {
this . add . video ( 400 , 300 ) . loadURL ( 'assets/aliens.mp4' ) ;
}
To all intents and purposes, a video is a standard Game Object, just like a Sprite. And as such, you can do all the usual things to it, such as scaling, rotating, cropping, tinting, making interactive, giving a physics body, etc.
Transparent videos are also possible via the WebM file format. Providing the video file has was encoded with an alpha channel, and providing the browser supports WebM playback (not all of them do), then it will render in-game with full transparency.
Playback is handled entirely via the Request Video Frame API, which is supported by most modern browsers. A polyfill is provided for older browsers.
Autoplaying Videos
Videos can only autoplay if the browser has been unlocked with an interaction, or satisfies the MEI settings. The policies that control autoplaying are vast and vary between browser. You can, and should, read more about it here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Autoplay_guide
If your video doesn't contain any audio, then set the noAudio parameter to true when the video is loaded, and it will often allow the video to play immediately:
preload ( ) {
this . load . video ( 'pixar' , 'nemo.mp4' , true ) ;
}
The 3rd parameter in the load call tells Phaser that the video doesn't contain any audio tracks. Video without audio can autoplay without requiring a user interaction. Video with audio cannot do this unless it satisfies the browsers MEI settings. See the MDN Autoplay Guide for further details.
Or:
create ( ) {
this . add . video ( 400 , 300 ) . loadURL ( 'assets/aliens.mp4' , true ) ;
}
You can set the noAudio parameter to true even if the video does contain audio. It will still allow the video to play immediately, but the audio will not start.
Note that due to a bug in IE11 you cannot play a video texture to a Sprite in WebGL. For IE11 force Canvas mode.
More details about video playback and the supported media formats can be found on MDN:

Load video ​
this . load . video ( key , url , noAudio ) ;
Reference: load video
!!! note "Cross-origin" Can't load video cross-origin via this.load.video(...) .
Using this.add.video(x, y).loadURL(urls, noAudio, crossOrigin) to load video cross-origin.
Add video object ​
Reference video from Video Cache ​
var video = this . add . video ( x , y , key ) ;
key : Key of the Video this Game Object will play, as stored in the Video Cache.
Load video from URL ​
Add video object
var video = this . add . video ( x , y ) ;
Play video from URL
video . loadURL ( url ) ;
// video.loadURL(urls, noAudio, crossOrigin);
noAudio : Does the video have an audio track? If not you can enable auto-playing on it.
false : Has audio track. Default behavior.
crossOrigin : The value to use for the crossOrigin property in the video load request.
undefined : crossorigin will not be set in the request. Default behavior.
'anonymous'
'use-credentials'
Load video from MediaStream ​
video . loadMediaStream ( stream ) ;
// video.loadMediaStream(stream, noAudio, crossOrigin);
stream : The MediaStream object.
noAudio : Does the video have an audio track? If not you can enable auto-playing on it.
false : Has audio track. Default behavior.
crossOrigin : The value to use for the crossOrigin property in the video load request.
undefined : crossorigin will not be set in the request. Default behavior.
'anonymous'
'use-credentials'
navigator . mediaDevices . getUserMedia ( { video : true , audio : false } )
. then ( function ( stream ) {
video . loadMediaStream ( stream , true ) ;
video . play ( ) ;
} )
. catch ( function ( err ) {
} )
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia
Size ​
Initial size : 256x265 ( video.setSize(256, 256) )
Size after playing : Size of video from metadata
Play ​
video . play ( ) ;
// video.play(loop, markerIn, markerOut);
loop : Should the video loop automatically when it reaches the end? Please note that not all browsers support seamless video looping for all encoding formats.
markerIn , markerOut : Optional in/out marker time, in seconds, for playback of a sequence of the video.
!!! note "Play video first time" Call video.play() when playing video first time.
!!! note If you need audio in your videos, then you'll have to consider the fact that the video cannot start playing until the user has interacted with the browser , into your game flow.
Pause ​
Pause
video . setPaused ( ) ;
// video.setPaused(true);
Resume
video . setPaused ( false ) ;
!!! note "Play video after paused" Call video.setPaused(false) to resume playing.
Stop ​
Stops the video playing and clears all internal event listeners.
video . stop ( ) ;
Is playing ​
Is playing
var isPlaying = video . isPlaying ( ) ; // (not PAUSE) and (not not ENDED)
Is paused
var isPaused = video . isPaused ( ) ;
Playback time ​
Get
var playbackTime = video . getCurrentTime ( ) ;
or
var t = video . getProgress ( ) ; // t: 0~1
Set
Set to
video . setCurrentTime ( playbackTime ) ; // time in seconds
or
video . seekTo ( t ) ; // t: 0~1
Is seeking
var isSeeking = video . isSeeking ( ) ;
Forward
video . setCurrentTime ( '+' + time ) ; // time in seconds
// video.setCurrentTime('+2');
Backeard
video . setCurrentTime ( '-' + time ) ; // time in seconds
// video.setCurrentTime('-2');
Playback rate ​
Get
var rate = video . getPlaybackRate ( ) ;
Set
video . setPlaybackRate ( rate ) ;
Duration ​
var duration = video . getDuration ( ) ; // time in seconds
Volume ​
Get
var volume = video . getVolume ( ) ; // volume: 0~1
Set
video . setVolume ( volume ) ; // volume: 0~1
Mute ​
Get
var muted = video . isMuted ( ) ; // muted: true/false
Set
video . setMute ( muted ) ; // muted: true/false
Loop ​
Get
var loop = video . getLoop ( ) ; // loop: true/false
Set
video . setLoop ( loop ) ; // loop: true/false
Video key ​
Get
var key = video . getVideoKey ( ) ;
Change video key (video source)
video . changeSource ( key ) ;
// video.changeSource(key, autoplay, loop, markerIn, markerOut);
autoplay : Should the video start playing immediately, once the swap is complete?
loop : Should the video loop automatically when it reaches the end? Not all browsers support seamless video looping for all encoding formats .
markerIn , markerOut : Optional in/out marker time, in seconds , for playback of a sequence of the video.
Marks ​
Add mark
video . addMarker ( key , markerIn , markerOut ) ;
key : A unique name to give this marker.
markerIn , markerOut : The time, in seconds, representing the start/end of this marker.
Play mark
video . playMarker ( key , loop ) ;
Remove mark
video . removeMarker ( key ) ;
Snapshot ​
Allocate a canvas texrure
video . saveSnapshotTexture ( key ) ;
key : Texture key.
Take a snapshot
var canvasTexture = video . video . snapshot ( ) ;
// var canvasTexture = video.snapshot(width, height);
or
var canvasTexture = video . snapshotArea ( x , y , srcWidth , srcHeight ) ;
// var canvasTexture = video.snapshotArea(x, y, srcWidth, srcHeight, destWidth, destHeight);
x , y : The horizontal/vertical location of the top-left of the area to grab from.
srcWidth , srcHeight : The width/height of area to grab from the video.
destWidth , destHeight : The destination width/height of the grab, allowing you to resize it.
canvasTexture : Canvas texture object.
Get key of texture
var key = canvasTexture . key ;
Save texture ​
The saved texture is automatically updated as the video plays. If you pause this video, or change its source, then the saved texture updates instantly.
var texture = video . saveTexture ( key ) ;
// var texture = video.saveTexture(key, flipY);
flipY : Set to true if use it as the input for a Shader.
