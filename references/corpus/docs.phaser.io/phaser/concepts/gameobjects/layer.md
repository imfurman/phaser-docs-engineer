Layer
A Layer is a special type of Game Object that acts as a Display List. You can add any type of Game Object to a Layer, just as you would to a Scene. Layers can be used to visually group together 'layers' of Game Objects:
const spaceman = this . add . sprite ( 150 , 300 , 'spaceman' ) ;
const bunny = this . add . sprite ( 400 , 300 , 'bunny' ) ;
const elephant = this . add . sprite ( 650 , 300 , 'elephant' ) ;
const layer = this . add . layer ( ) ;
layer . add ( [ spaceman , bunny , elephant ] ) ;
The 3 sprites in the example above will now be managed by the Layer they were added to. Therefore, if you then set layer.setVisible(false) they would all vanish from the display.
You can also control the depth of the Game Objects within the Layer. For example, calling the setDepth method of a child of a Layer will allow you to adjust the depth of that child within the Layer itself, rather than the whole Scene. The Layer, too, can have its depth set as well.
The Layer class also offers many different methods for manipulating the list, such as the methods moveUp , moveDown , sendToBack , bringToTop and so on. These allow you to change the display list position of the Layers children, causing it to adjust the order in which they are rendered. Using setDepth on a child allows you to override this.
Layers can have Post FX Pipelines set, which allows you to easily enable a post pipeline across a whole range of children, which, depending on the effect, can often be far more efficient that doing so on a per-child basis.
Layers have no position or size within the Scene. This means you cannot enable a Layer for physics or input, or change the position, rotation or scale of a Layer. They also have no scroll factor, texture, tint, origin, crop or bounds.
If you need those kind of features then you should use a Container instead. Containers can be added to Layers, but Layers cannot be added to Containers.
However, you can set the Alpha, Blend Mode, Depth, Mask and Visible state of a Layer. These settings will impact all children being rendered by the Layer.
Add layer ​
var layer = this . add . layer ( ) ;
// var layer = this.add.layer(children);
children : Array of game objects added to this layer.
Custom class ​
class MyLayer extends Phaser . GameObjects . Layer {
constructor ( scene , children ) {
super ( scene , children ) ;
// ...
this . add . existing ( this ) ;
}
// ...
// preUpdate(time, delta) {}
}
this.add.existing(gameObject) : Adds an existing Game Object to this Scene.
If the Game Object renders, it will be added to the Display List.
If it has a preUpdate method, it will be added to the Update List.
Example
var layer = new MyLayer ( scene , children ) ;
Add child ​
Add child
layer . add ( gameObject ) ;
// layer.add(gameObjects);
gameObject : A game object, or an array of game objects.
Add child at
layer . addAt ( gameObject , index ) ;
Replace child
layer . replace ( oldGameObject , newGameObject ) ;
Remove child ​
Remove child
var removed = layer . remove ( gameObject ) ;
Remove child at
var removed = layer . removeAt ( index ) ;
Remove children between indexes
var removed = layer . removeBetween ( startIndex , endIndex ) ;
Remove all children
layer . removeAll ( ) ;
Removed game object won't be added to display list of scene, use
gameObject . addToDisplayList ( ) ;
to add it back to scene's display list.
Get child ​
Get child at
var gameObject = layer . getAt ( index ) ;
Get first child by name
var gameObject = layer . getByName ( name ) ;
Get first child by property
var gameObject = layer . getFirst ( property , value ) ;
// var gameObject = layer.getFirst(property, value, startIndex, endIndex);
Get random child
var gameObject = layer . getRandom ( ) ;
// var gameObject = layer.getRandom(startIndex, length);
Get all children
var gameObjects = layer . getAll ( ) ;
Get index of child
var index = layer . getIndex ( gameObject ) ;
Get child count
var count = layer . count ( property , value ) ;
Get total children count
var count = layer . length ;
Has child
var hasChild = layer . exists ( gameObject ) ;
Iterate ​
Get first child (set iterator index to 0)
var gameObject = layer . first ;
Get last child (set iterator index to last)
var gameObject = layer . last ;
Get next child (increase iterator index, until last)
var gameObject = layer . next ;
Get previous child (decrease iterator index, until 0)
var gameObject = layer . previous ;
Move child ​
Swap
layer . swap ( gameObject1 , gameObject2 ) ;
Move to
layer . moveTo ( gameObject , index ) ;
Bring to top
layer . bringToTop ( gameObject ) ;
Send to back
layer . sendToBack ( gameObject ) ;
Move up
layer . moveUp ( gameObject ) ;
Move down
layer . moveDown ( gameObject ) ;
Move child1 above child2
layer . moveAbove ( child1 , child2 ) ;
Move child1 below child2
layer . moveBelow ( child1 , child2 ) ;
Sort
layer . sort ( property ) ;
or
layer . sort ( '' , function ( gameObject1 , gameObject2 ) {
return 1 ; // 0, or -1
} ) ;
Reverse
layer . reverse ( ) ;
Shuffle
layer . shuffle ( ) ;
!!! note Sort by depth Children game objects also sort by depth.
For each child ​
layer . each ( function ( gameObject ) {
} , scope ) ;
Set property ​
layer . setAll ( property , value ) ;
// layer.setAll(property, value, startIndex, endIndex);
Events ​
On add game object
layer . events . on ( 'addedtoscene' , function ( gameObject , scene ) {
} )
On remove game object
layer . events . on ( 'removedfromscene' , function ( gameObject , scene ) {
} )
layer.events references to this.events .
Other properties ​
See game object
Create mask ​
var mask = layer . createBitmapMask ( ) ;
See mask
Shader effects ​
Support postFX effects
!!! note No preFX effect support
