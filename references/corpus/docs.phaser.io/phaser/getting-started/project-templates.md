Project Templates
Phaser has support for all of the major front-end frameworks and bundlers. The templates are all presented on GitHub using the 'template' setting, allowing you to select the 'Use this template' feature. This allows you to copy the template to your own repository, or open it into GitHub Codespaces.
We support all of the following frameworks and bundlers:
Frameworks Bundlers
